by insisting that I owe him nothing more than he thinks he owes

me. But that is an incoherent solution, among its other difficulties,

because he would not know what he owes me until I had decided

what I owe him, and I began by not knowing this.

22. I owe this example to Donald Davidson.

23. Large questions about justice, including questions about

how far justice extends beyond human beings to at least some

other animals, are raised by this hasty observation, which I do not

pursue.

24. I 1gnore the special problem of Northern Ireland here.

25. See the discussion of personification in Chapter 5.

26. This kind of concern is sometimes called ‘“‘altruism.” See

Duncan Kennedy, “Form and Substance in Private Law Adjudi-

cation,” 89 Harvard Law Review 1685 (1976).

27. It 1s not so obvious that it did. See Robert M. Cover, fustice

Accused: Antislavery and the Judicial Process (New Haven, 1975), and

my review of it in the Times Literary Supplement, Dec. 5, 1975.

The distinction is frequently employed in A Matter of Principle.

32. This was, perhaps, the underlying issue, not made plain in

the opinions, in Gouriet v. The Union of Post Office Workers [1977] 1

All E.R. 696 (Court of Appeal), 1978 A.C. 435 (House of Lords).

1. Perhaps this is an impossible assignment; perhaps the project

1s doomed to produce not just an impossibly bad novel but no

novel at all, because the best theory of art requires a single creator

or, if more than one, that each must have some control over the

whole. (But what about legends and jokes? What about the Old

Testament, or, on some theories, the [li1ad’) I need not push that

question further, because I am interested only in the fact that the

assignment makes sense, that each of the novelists in the chain can
