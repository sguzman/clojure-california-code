THE COMMON LAW

damage caused by their sparks, even if it was unreasonable

for them to drive at the speed they did. Suppose a train

drives at 150 miles per hour, which is unreasonable because

it endangers crops that are worth more than the marginal

profits gained by driving at that speed; the sparks do in fact

burn the crops, but as it turns out, only because the farmer

has spilled lighter fluid in the area. Our legislator might con-

sider three rules for situations of that sort. He might say,

first, that since the train’s activity was concededly unreason-

able, 1t should be liable for all the damage that resulted from

that activity, even the damage that would not have been

caused had the farmer not also behaved carelessly. Or he

might say, second, that since the farmer’s carelessness was an

essential part of the causal chain, he should bear the entire

loss, because he was, in the phrase that has been developed

to make this point, “contributorily negligent.” Or he might

decide that since the train company and the farmer both

acted unreasonably, the company must compensate the

farmer for part but not all of his loss. In that case he would

have chosen what i1s sometimes called the doctrine of “com-

parative’ negligence, which assigns loss to all the parties be-

having unreasonably in a particular situation in accordance

with how unreasonably each behaved, or how far the unrea-

sonable behavior of each contributed to the accident, or

some combination of both. It is an interesting and complex

question of economics which of these various rules about

compensation, when more than one party behaves unreason-

ably, would actually contribute most to community wealth.

YR, TR R )

The champions of the economic theory try to show (in much

greater detail and with much more subtlety, noticing quali-

fications and difficulties I have ignored) what my argument

has now begun to suggest. For the various rules and devices I

have described—those a legislator who 1s concerned only to

maximize the total wealth of the community would consider
