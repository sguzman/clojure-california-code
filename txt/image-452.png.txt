might have about the value or character of what will then be pro-

duced.

2. See the debate cited in Chapter 2, n. 16.

3. See A Matter of Principle chap. 7.

4. Hercules played an important part in Taking Rights Seriously

chap. 4.

5. See the discussion of critical legal studies later in this chap-

ter.

6. The disagreement between Lords Edmund Davies and Scar-

Davics, on the one hand, and Viscount Dilhourne on the other, in
