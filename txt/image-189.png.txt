INTEGRITY

AGENDA

We have two principles of political integrity: a legislative

principle, which asks lawmakers to try to make the total set

of laws morally coherent, and an adjudicative principle,

which instructs that the law be seen as coherent in that way,

so far as possible. Our main concern 1s with the adjudicative

principle, but not yet. In this chapter I argue that the legisla-

tive principle is so much part of our political practice that no

competent interpretation of that practice can ignore i1it. We

measure that claim on the two dimensions now familiar. We

ask whether the assumption, that integrity is a distinct 1deal

of politics, fits our politics, and then whether 1t honors our

politics. If the legislative principle of integrity 1s impressive

on both these dimensions, then the case for the adjudicative

principle, and for the conception of law 1t supports, will al-

ready be well begun.

DOES INTEGRITY FIT?

Integrity and Compromise

Integrity would not be needed as a distinct political virtue in

a utopian state. Coherence would be guaranteed because of-

ordinary politics, however, we must treat integrity as an In-

dependent ideal if we accept 1t at all, because i1t can conflict

with these other ideals. It can require us to support legisla-

tion we believe would be inappropriate in the perfectly just
