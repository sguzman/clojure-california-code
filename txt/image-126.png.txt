duties to obey the law, are complementary to classical

theories of law, because theories of civil disobedience are

mainly about force and hardly about grounds at all. They

the sort of thing that we all accept as grounds of law—the

paradigms of the day—when are citizens morally free to dis-

obey what counts as law on those grounds?” Of course this

process of abstracting from one kind of disagreement to focus

on another would be unsuccessful if the parties disagreed too

much about the grounds of law, if one rejected everything

the other took as paradigmatic. It would make no sense to

debate how far law should be obeyed if one side thought that

the enactments of Parliament were the only source of law

and the other side gave that power to the Bible. But if many
