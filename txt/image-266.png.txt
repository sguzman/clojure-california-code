INTEGRITY IN LAW

rather than beyond a reasonable doubt because the probable

standard fits the combined department as well as any other.

But Hercules will not be so ready to defer to local priority

when his test i1s not met, when traditional boundaries be-

tween departments have become mechanical and arbitrary,

cither because popular morality has shifted or because the

substance of the departments no longer reflects popular

opinion.”” Compartments of law do sometimes grow arbi-

trary and isolated from popular conviction in that way, par-

ticularly when the central rules of the departments were

developed in different periods. Suppose the legal tradition of

a community has for many decades separated nuisance law,

which concerns the discomfort of interference that activities

on one person’s land cause to neighbors, from negligence

law, which concerns the physical or economic or emotional

injurlies someone’s carelessness inflicts on others. Suppose

that the judges who decided the crucial nuisance cases dis-

dained any economic test for nuisance; they said that an ac-

tivity counts as a nuisance, and must therefore be stopped,

when 1t is not a “natural’ or traditional use of the land, so

that someone who starts a factory on land traditionally used

for farming is guilty of nuisance even though the factory is

an economically more efficient use. But suppose that in re-

cent years judges have begun to make economic cost crucial

for negligence. They say that someone’s failure to take pre-

cautions against injuring others is negligent, so that he is

liable for the resulting injury if the precaution was ‘“‘reason-

able” 1n the circumstances, and that the economic cost of the

precaution counts in deciding whether 1t was in fact reason-

able.

The distinction between negligence and nuisance law no

longer meets Hercules’ test, if it ever did. It makes some sense

to distinguish nuisance from negligence i1f we assume that

nuisance is Intentional while negligence 1s unintentional,

then the distinction tracks the popular principle that it is

worse to 1njure someone knowingly than unknowingly. But

the developments in negligence law I just described are not
