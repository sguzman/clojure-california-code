PRAGMATISM AND PERSONIFICATION

{0Y

g the right balance between accuracy and efficiency in en-

forcing some part of the law be recognized throughout, tak-

ing into account differences in the kind and degree of moral

harm an inaccurate verdict imposes. These several claims

justify a commitment to consistency in principle valued for

its own sake. They suggest what I shall argue: that integrity

rather than some superstition of elegance is the life of law as

we know 1t.

It will be useful to divide the claims of integrity into two

more practical principles. The first is the principle of integ-

rity in legislation, which asks those who create law by legisla-

tion to keep that law coherent in principle. The second is the

principle of integrity in adjudication: 1t asks those responsi-

ble for deciding what the law is to see and enforce it as coher-

ent in that way. The second principle explains how and why

the past must be allowed some special power of its own in

court, contrary to the pragmatistâ€™s claim that it must not. It

explains why judges must conceive the body of law they ad-

minister as a whole rather than as a set of discrete decisions

that they are free to make or amend one by one, with noth-

ing but a strategic interest in the rest.

COMMUNITY PERSONIFIED

The adjudicative principle of integrity furnishes our third

conception of law. We shall study law as integrity, and I

shall commend it, in the chapters that follow. Many readers

will be troubled, however, by one aspect of political integ-

rity, which we might well take up in advance. Political integ-

rity assumes a particularly deep personification of the

community or state. It supposes that the community as a

whole can be committed to principles of fairness or justice or

procedural due process in some way analogous to the way

particular people can be committed to convictions or ideals

or projects, and this will strike many people as bad meta-

physics.
