CONVENTIONALISM

legislative stage: they would have tried to discover which de-

cision was more sensible or just or democratic or would oth-

erwise better serve the community. They would not have

pressed on with the kind of arguments they actually did use,

probing the statute, obsessed with the question whether one

decision was more consistent with its text, or spirit, or the

right relation between i1t and the rest of law.

These latter arguments, fixed in different ways on the

question of how the statute should be read, make sense only

on the assumption that the law judges have an obligation to

enforce depends on the “correct” reading even when it is

controversial what that 1s; this 1s exactly the assumption

conventionalism denies. Nor 1s Elmer’s case unusual in pro-

viding this kind of counterexample. In the snail darter case

the justices of the Supreme Court argued about the proper

way to rcad the Environmental Protection Act. They dis-

agreed whether they were obligated by the correct theory of

legislation to enforce the most literal or the most sensible

reading of the statute in the absence of any reliable evidence

about what Congress actually intended. The judges who de-

cided McLoughlin worried about the most accurate descrip-

tion of the principles underlying the precedent cases cited to

them, although they knew that nothing in the explicit ex-

tension of any convention settled what these principles were

or what weight they should be given. In Brown the Supreme

Court argued about which scheme of justice was presup-

posed by the structure of the Constitution, about the place of

the equal protection clause in that scheme, about the true

impact of that clause on the legal power of Kansas to legis-

late a school system, even though each justice knew that

none of this was settled by convention.

I do not mean that a self-conscious conventionalist would

1gnore statutes and precedents altogether once 1t was contro-

versial what force these should be given. He would not treat

them as sources of law past that point, but his general re-

sponsibility when he believes that law has run out 1s to make

the best new law he can for the future, and he might be con-
