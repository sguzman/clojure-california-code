THE COMMON LAW

THE ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION

In the last chapter we used Hercules to explore a single issue

in the law of accidents. In this chapter we let him rest for

more labors later; we study accident law as a whole in a

more abstract and academic fashion, trying to find a deeper,

more general, and philosophical justification for the “rea-

sonable foresight” principle he settled on. A large interpre-

tive claim has recently excited lawyers in the United States

and been noticed in Britain, called the “economic’ theory of

the law of unintended damage. This offers a general inter-

pretation of the decisions our judges have made about acci-

dents and nuisance and other unintended injury.' It finds

the key to these decisions in the “economic” principle that

people should always act in whatever way will be financially

least expensive for their community as a whole. Suppose 1

can avold injuring you by fitting my car with a safety device.

If I do not, and I injure you, then under this principle I must

compensate you for your losses if the safety device would

have cost me less than the “discounted” cost of the accident,

that is, the cost discounted by the chance that it might not

occur even without the device. But I need not compensate

you if the cost of installing the device would have been

higher than the discounted cost of the accident.”

Community Wealth and the Coase Theorem

The economic theory suggests that the best interpretation of

accident cases 1s furnished by the economic principle. We
