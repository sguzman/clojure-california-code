STATUTES

LEGISLATIVE INTENTION

One day the snail darter case comes to Hercules’ court. He

must decide whether the Endangered Species Act gives the

secretary of the interior power to halt a vast, almost finished

fcderal power project to save a small and ecologically unin-

tcresting fish, so he must first decide how to read statutes

whose meaning is uncertain. My argument 1s complex, and I

shall tell you at once how it ends. Hercules will use much the

same techniques of interpretation to read statutes that he

uses to decide common-law cases, the techniques we studied

in the last two chapters. He will treat Congress as an author

carlier than himself in the chain of law, though an author

with special powers and responsibilities different from his

own, and he will see his own role as fundamentally the crea-

tive one of a partner continuing to develop, in what he be-

licves is the best way, the statutory scheme Congress began.

[Ie will ask himself which reading of the act—permitting or

not permitting the secretary to halt projects almost com-

pleted—shows the political history including and surround-

ing that statute in the better light. His view of how the

statute should be read will in part depend on what certain

congressmen said when debating it. But 1t will also depend

on the best answer to political questions: how far Congress

should defer to public opinion in matters of this sort, for ex-

ample, and whether it would be absurd as a matter of policy

lo protect a minor species at so great an expense of funds.'

| ¢ must rely on his own judgment in answering these ques-

tions, of course, not because he thinks his opinions are auto-
