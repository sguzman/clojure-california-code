STATUTES

ward these evidential difficulties. He accepts that he must

take more pains to discover the mental attitudes that lie be-

hind legislation than the mental states of people he meets in

pubs, that he must sometimes settle for judgments of specu-

lative probability, not practical certainty, and that in some

cases he must admit that he has no useful evidence of any

pertinent state of mind one way or the other and then be

prepared to decide that particular case some other way. I

shall not press this evidential difhculty. It i1s the least of

Hermes’ problems.

Who Are the Authors of a Statute?

Before he looks for evidence of thoughts past, he must decide

whose thoughts these were. Whose mental states count in

fixing the intention behind the Endangered Species Act?

Every member of the Congress that enacted it, including

those who voted against? Are the thoughts of some—for ex-

ample, those who spoke, or spoke most often, in the de-

bates—more important than the thoughts of others? What

about the executive officials and assistants who prepared the

initial drafts? What about the president who signed the bill

and made 1t law? Should his intentions not count more than

any single senator’s” What about private citizens who wrote

letters to their congressmen or promised or threatened to

vote for or against them, or to make or withhold campaign

contributions, depending upon how they voted? What about

the various lobbies and action groups who played their now-

normal role? Any realistic view of the legislative process in-

cludes the influence of these groups; if they contributed to

making the statute law, does Hermes have any good reason

for not counting their intentions in determining what law

they made?

There 1s a further complication. A statute owes its exis-

tence not only to the decision people made to enact it but

also to the decision of other people later not to amend or re-
