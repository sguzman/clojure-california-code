proposition that the framers’ concrete intentions fix constitutional

law.

11. Since this argument begins in the assumption that we are

committed to democracy and that our elections are democratic

enough to require deference to legislative decisions, 1t is especially

weak when the Court i1s asked to decide what the Constitution

counts as democracy. (See Ely, supra n. 5.) A passivist therefore

needs a further distinction: he needs to distinguish those constitu-

tional provisions that protect the fairness of the political process

from those meant to guarantee the justice of its results. If he be-

lieves that the right of free speech or the rights guaranteeing

treatment as equals to minority groups, for example, are best 1n-

terpreted as protecting the fairness of American democracy, then

he has no reason to defer to the judgment of elected officials about

when these rights have been violated. This qualification does not

jeopardize the passive approach generally, because it does not

apply to rights that are not properly understood that way, like al-

leged rights to an abortion or against the death penalty. A passive

justice who thinks that these putative rights sound in justice rather

than fairness will let elected officials decide whether the Constitu-

tion embraces them.
