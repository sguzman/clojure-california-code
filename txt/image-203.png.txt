INTEGRITY

interests conflict, to interpret the common scheme of justice

to which they are both committed just in virtue of citizen-

ship."

Integrity infuses political and private occasions each with

the spirit of the other to the benefit of both. This continuity

has practical as well as expressive value, because 1t facilitates

the organic style of change I mentioned a moment ago as a

practical advantage. But its expressive value is not ex-

hausted, as its practical value might be, when citizens dis-

agree about which scheme of justice is in fact embedded in

the community’s explicit political decisions. For the expres-

sive value is confirmed when people in good faith try to treat

one another in a way appropriate to common membership

In a community governed by political integrity and to see

each other as making this attempt, even when they disagree

about exactly what integrity requires 1n particular circum-

stances. Political obligation 1s then not just a matter of

obeying the discrete political decisions of the community one

by one, as political philosophers usually represent 1t. It be-

comes a more protestant idea: fidelity to a scheme of princi-

ple each citizen has a responsibility to identify, ultimately

for himself, as his community’s scheme.

THE PUZZLE OF LEGITIMACY

We now turn to the direct connection between integrity and

the moral authority of the law, and this bends our study

back toward the main argument of the book. I said that the

concept of law—the plateau where argument among con-

ceptions is most useful-—connects law with the justification

of official coercion. A conception of law must explain how

what it takes to be law provides a general justification for the

exercise of coercive power by the state, a justification that

holds except in special cases when some competing argu-

ment 1s specially powerful. Each conception’s organizing

center 1s the explanation it offers of this justifying force.
