STATUTES

RRW,

l.ls¢ problem; Hermes needs no combinatorial function of

mdividual legislators’ convictions because from the start he

mterprets the record of the institution not their records one

hy one. The doctrine celebrated in judicial rhetoric—that

~tatutes must be enforced looking to the intentions behind

them—now shows its true colors. It 1s only the principle of

adjudicative integrity we embraced in Chapter 6, cast as a

motto for judges reading statutes. We may leave Hermes.

| Iis new method needs careful elaboration, but not by him,

hecause he has become Hercules’ twin.

have some 1dea, because we know how Hercules interprets

common-law precedents. But statutes are different from

precedent judicial decisions, and we must study how Her-

cules proceeds when a statute rather than a set of law reports

has been placed before him. What would he do about the

snail darter case?

[ assume he has his own opinions about all the issues at

stake in the snail darter controversy. He has views about

conservation in general, about public power, about the

wisest way to develop the Appalachian area, about the con-

scrvation of species—in sum, about whether it would be best,

all things considered, to halt the TVA dam. Suppose he

wants the dam halted, not because he cares about the snail

darter or even about conservation of species, but on aesthetic

rrounds because he prefers to leave the water courses the
