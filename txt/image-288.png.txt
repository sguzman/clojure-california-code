successes. This assumes, however, that its aims are those of

law as integrity, that i1t works to discover whether, and how

far, judges have avenues open for improving law while re-

specting the virtues of fraternity integrity serves. These are

indeed the aims of at least some members of the move-

They may want to show law in its worst rather than its best

light, to show avenues closed that are in fact open, to move

toward a new mystification in service of undisclosed political

goals.
