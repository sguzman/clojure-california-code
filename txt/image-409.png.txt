THE CONSTITUTION

historicism in this context. For we know that the framers of

the Fourteenth Amendment did not believe they were mak-

ing any racial discrimination in education unconstitutional,

even segregation aimed at blacks, and we can hardly take

their opinions as an argument that al// racial distinction,

even that designed to help blacks, 1s outlawed.

Suppose Bakke’s lawyers now say that whatever the fram-

ers might or might not have intended, wise constitutional

statecraft argues for the banned category theory for race and

a few other categories alone because admissions or hiring

programs that use racial classifications in any way will exac-

erbate racial tension and so prolong discrimination, hatred,

and violence. This 1s exactly the kind of complex, forward-

looking calculation of policy that even a weakened, sensible

form of passivism would leave to the judgment of elected of-

ficials or of executives appointed by and responsible to these

officials. If Congress decides that a national policy prohib-

iting any affirmative action is desirable, it has the power

to enact a statute that will partly achieve this.** The Su-

preme Court should not take that judgment of policy upon

itself.

So Hercules will reject the banned categories theory of

equality, both in its general form, which cannot be made to

fit, and in its special form, which is too arbitrary to count as

principled. He will accept the banned sources theory as the

best interpretation available,” then construct a suitable

practical elaboration of that theory for constitutional pur-

poses by selecting a list, open to revision as social patterns

change, of “suspect” classifications whose use to disadvan-

tage a group historically the target of prejudice i1s prima

facie unconstitutional. The list he constructs would not out-

law afirmative action programs in principle, because these

do not work to the disadvantage of any such group.

But Bakke has one more possible argument that the equal

protection clause, interpreted as Hercules now understands

it, does outlaw the particular quota-based form of affirma-

tive action Davis used. The banned sources theory explicates
