PRAGMATISM AND PERSONIFICATION

)

our offictals must treat all members of the community they

govern as equals because we believe they should behave that

way, not the other way around. We cannot explain the spe-

cial responsibilities of political office, therefore, if we try to

build these directly from ordinary principles of private mo-

rality. We need an i1dea that cannot be found there: that the

community as a whole has obligations of impartiality to-

ward 1ts members, and that officials act as agents for the

community in acquitting that responsibility. Here, as in the

case of the corporation, we need to treat group responsibility

as logically prior to the responsibilities of officials one by

One.

These various examples of working personification of the

community fit together as partners in a general system of

thought. Once we accept that our officials act in the name of

a community of which we are all members, bearing a respon-

sibility we therefore share, then this reinforces and sustains

the character of collective guilt, our sense that we must feel

shame as well as outrage when they act unjustly. The practi-

cal principles of integrity I cited—integrity in legislation and

in adjudication—take their places in this system of ideas.

The adjudicative principle is our special interest because it

provides a conception of law antagonistic to pragmatism. If

that principle can be sustained, pragmatism must be re-

jected.
