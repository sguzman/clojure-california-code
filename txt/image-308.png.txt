fact be arguing backward, from the fact that our moral

practices do make these discriminations to the unwarranted

conclusion that they must promote utility better in the long

run than other feasible schemes of responsibility.

THE EGALITARIAN

INTERPRETATION

Private and Public Responsibility

We should therefore look for a different scheme of responsi-

bility that also recommends market-simulating behavior

when abstract legal rights conflict but does not suppose any

personal duty always to act in whatever way would make the

community happier on the whole. So far we have been as-

suming that because market-simulating behavior minimizes

financial losses among those affected by some conduct and

therefore improves the wealth of the community as a whole,

it must be required, when it 1s, for that reason. We should

explore another possibility: that though market-simulating

behavior normally does improve the wealth of the commu-

nity, 1t is required for some different reason. Our argument

has already suggested the general character of another rea-

son. Someone who abstains from some act on the ground

that it would cost his neighbor more than it would benefit

him takes his neighborâ€™s welfare into account on equal terms

with his own; a duty to act in that way might be thought to

rest on some egalitarian basis.

The utilitarian argument I constructed just now exploited

that idea in one way. It supposed that we each have a gen-

eral duty always to treat the interests of others as equal in

importance to our own, and it derived from that general

duty a further duty always to act to make the community

richer on the whole. We found the derivation doubtful but

accepted 1t arguendo to consider the general duty, which we

then found implausible. Can we exploit the egalitarian basis

of accident law more successfully if we reject the general
