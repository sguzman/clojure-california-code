THREE

JURISPRUDENCE REVISITED

A NEW PICTURE

We have drawn the semantic sting and no longer need the

caricature of legal practice offered in semantic theories. We

can see more clearly now, and this is what we see. Law 1s an

interpretive concept like courtesy in my imagined example.

Judges normally recognize a duty to continue rather than

discard the practice they have joined. So they develop, in re-

sponse to their own convictions and instincts, working

theories about the best interpretation of their responsibilities

under that practice. When they disagree in what I called the

theoretical way, their disagreements are interpretive. They

disagree, in large measure or in fine detail, about the sound-

est interpretation of some pertinent aspect of judicial prac-

tice. So Elmer’s fate will depend on the interpretive

convictions of the particular panel of judges that decides his

case. If a judge thinks it follows from the best interpretation

of what judges characteristically do about statutes that he

should never look to legislators’ intentions, then he might

well decide for Elmer. But if, on the contrary, he thinks that

the best interpretation requires him to look to their inten-

tions, then he will probably decide for Goneril and Regan. If

Elmer’s case comes before a judge who has not yet thought

about this issue of interpretation, that judge will have to do

so then, and he will find lawyers on both sides willing to

help. Interpretations struggle side by side with litigants be-

fore the bar.

Each judge’s interpretive theories are grounded in his own

convictions about the “point”—the justifying purpose or
