WHAT IS LAW?

when a plaintiff with a sound claim i1s turned away from

court or a defendant leaves with an undeserved stigma

These are the direct effects of a lawsuit on the parties and

their dependents. In Britain and America, among other

places, judicial decisions affect a great many other people as

well, because the law often becomes what judges say it is

The decisions of the United States Supreme Court, for ex-

ample, are famously important in this way. That Court has

the power to overrule even the most deliberate and popular

decisions of other departments of government if it believes

they are contrary to the Constitution, and 1t therefore has

the last word on whether and how the states may execute

murderers or prohibit abortions or require prayers in the

public schools, on whether Congress can draft soldiers to

general importance as well. Here are two examples; chosen

almost at random, from English legal history. In the nine-

could not sue his employer for compensation if he was in-

jured through the carelessness of another employee.” They

sald that a worker ¢

‘assumes the risk” that his “fellow ser-

vants”’ might be careless, and anyway that the worker knows

more than the employer about which other workers are

careless and perhaps has more influence over them. This rule

(which seemed less silly when Darwinian images of capital-

ism were more popular) much influenced the law of com-

pensation for industrial accidents until 1t was finally

abandoned.” In 1975 Lord Widgery, a very influential judge

in Britain, laid down rules stipulating how long a Cabinet

officer must wait after leaving office to publish descriptions

of confidential Cabinet meetings.* That decision fixed the
