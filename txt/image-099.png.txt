INTERPRETIVE CONCEPTS

pertinent to deciding which of competing accounts of legal

practice provides the best justification of that practice. My

advice 1s straightforward: this preliminary dance of skepti-

cism is silly and wasteful; it neither adds to nor subtracts

from the business at hand. The only skepticism worth any-

thing 1s skepticism of the internal kind, and this must be

earned by arguments of the same contested character as the

arguments it opposes, not claimed in advance by some pre-

tense at hard-hitting empirical metaphysics.

We must continue our study of interpretation, and of law,

in that spirit. I shall offer arguments about what makes one

interpretation of a social practice better than another, and

about what account of law provides the most satisfactory in-

terpretation of that complex and crucial practice. These ar-

guments will not—because they cannot—be demonstrations.

They invite disagreement, and though it will not be wrong

P

to reply, “But that’s only your opinion,

neither will 1t be

helpful. You must then ask yourself whether, after reflection,

it 1s your opinion as well. If 1t 1s, you will think that my ar-

guments and conclusions are sound and that other, conflict-

ing ones, are unsound and wrong. If it is not your opinion,

then it falls to you to say why not, to match my arguments or

naked convictions with your own. For the exercise in hand is

one of discovery at least in this sense: discovering which view

of the sovereign matters we discuss sorts best with the con-

victions we each, together or severally, have and retain

about the best account of our common practices.
