Conceptions of Equality

Libertarian conceptions of equality suppose that people

have “natural” rights over whatever property they have ac-

quired in certain canonical ways and that government treats

people as equals when it protects their possession and enjoy-

ment of that property. Welfare-based conceptions, on the

other hand, deny any natural right in property and insist in-

stead that government must produce, distribute, and regu-

late property to achieve results defined by some specified

function of the happiness or welfare of individuals. Utilitari-

anism, in the form just discussed, is one welfare-based con-

ception of equality: it holds that government treats people as

equals 1n 1ts scheme of property when its rules secure roughly

the greatest possible average welfare, counting the happi-

ness or success of each person in the same way. Equality

of welfare 1s a different theory of this same class: it re-

quires government to design and distribute property so as

to make the welfare of all citizens roughly equal, so far as

possible.

A third group of theories demands that government aim

at outcomes defined in the vocabulary not of welfare but of

goods, opportunities, and other resources. One such the-

ory—material equality—requires government to make the

material wealth of all citizens as nearly equal as possible

throughout their lives. Another, which I shall call equality of

resources, requires it to make an equal share of resources

availlable for each to consume or invest as he wishes. Equal-

ity of resources, unlike material equality, assumes that peo-

ple’s wealth should differ as they make different choices

about investment and consumption. It supposes that if peo-

ple begin with the same wealth and other resources, then

equality is preserved through market transactions among

them, even though some grow richer than others and some

happier through these transactions. Equality of resources

recognizes, however, that differences in talent are differences

in resources, and for that reason it seeks in some way to
