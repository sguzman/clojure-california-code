INTERPRETIVE CONCEPTS

into politics. The libertarian philosopher opposes income

taxes and the egalitarian philosopher calls for more redistri-

bution because their conceptions of justice differ. There is

nothing neutral about these conceptions. They are interpre-

from that commitment.

SKEPTICISM ABOUT INTERPRETATION

think in order to embrace one interpretation rather than an-

other. But the interpretive attitude I described, the attitude I

tation of something—a poem or a play or a social practice

like courtesy or justice—can one sensibly think he is right

and others wrong? We must be careful to distinguish this

question from a different one, about the complexity of inter-

pretation. It sounds dogmatic, and is usually a mistake, to

suppose that a complex work of art—Hamlet, for example—is

“about” any one thing and nothing else, so that one produc-

tion of that play would be uniquely right or accurate, and

not complexity. Can one interpretive view be objectively

better than another when they are not merely different,

bringing out different and complementary aspects of a com-

Most people think they can, that some interpretations
