NOTES TO PAGES 401-402

of precedent, has a duty to enforce that precedent and so decide

for the defendant. He might say (this is one way to put the point)

that the law for the higher court is different from the law for the

lower. Or he might say (this i1s another) that since the highest

court has the last word, the law 1s “really” for the plaintiff, though

she must appeal to have that law recognized and enforced. The

vocabulary of law, here as in the case of the wicked legal systems

in Chapter 3, 1s flexible enough to allow us to describe the same

complex structure of legal relations—rights and duties enforceable

in specified circumstances—In different ways depending on audi-

ence, context, and purpose.

2. I neglect to repeat the major lesson of Chapter g, that sub-

stantive integrity will play a great role in Hercules’ decision how

to read vague or ambiguous or otherwise troublesome language in

this statute. I am assuming, here, that the text and context and

legislative history are sufficiently crisp so that even Hercules’ style

of reading statutes yields the inconsistency with the rest of the law

I assume 1n the text.

3. Saif Ali, cited in Chapter 6, n. 28, may prove to be an early

warning of that sort. If Hercules believes integrity requires recog-

nizing the procedural constraint in the case in which he lays down

the warning, he thinks the law 1s for the barrister then. But once

the warning has been given, that constraint is removed, so the law

will not be for the barrister in a later case.
