INTEGRITY IN LAW

ciently attractive to provide an honorable future. Law as in-

tegrity deplores the mechanism of the older “law is law”

view as well as the cynicism of the newer “realism.” It sees

both views as rooted in the same false dichotomy of finding

and inventing law. When a judge declares that a particular

principle is instinct in law, he reports not a simple-minded

claim about the motives of past statesmen, a claim a wise

cynic can easlily refute, but an interpretive proposal: that the

principle both fits and justifies some complex part of legal

practice, that it provides an attractive way to see, 1n the

structure of that practice, the consistency of principle integ-

rity requires. Law’s optimism 1s in that way conceptual,;

claims of law are endemically constructive, just in virtue of

the kind of claims they are. This optimism may be mis-

placed: legal practice may in the end yield to nothing but a

deeply skeptical interpretation. But that 1s not inevitable

just because a community’s history is one of great change

and conflict. An imaginative interpretation can be con-

structed on morally complicated, even ambiguous terrain.

THE CHAIN OF LAW

F0 TR N

I argued in Chapter 2 that creative interpretation takes its

formal structure from the idea of intention, not (at least not

necessarily) because it aims to discover the purposes of any

particular historical person or group but because it aims to

impose purpose over the text or data or tradition being in-

terpreted. Since all creative interpretation shares this fea-

ture, and therefore has a normative aspect or component, we

profit from comparing law with other forms or occasions of

interpretation. We can usefully compare the judge deciding

what the law is on some issue not only with the citizens of

courtesy deciding what that tradition requires, but with the

literary critic teasing out the various dimensions of value in a

complex play or poem.
