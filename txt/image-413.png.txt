LAW BEYOND LAW

LAW WORKS ITSELLF PURE

Can Integrity Be Impure?

Sentimental lawyers cherish an old trope: they say that law

works itself pure. The figure imagines two forms or stages of

the same system of law, the nobler form latent in the less

noble, the impure, present law gradually transforming itself

Into its own purer ambition, haltingly, to be sure, with slides

as well as gains, never worked finally pure, but better in each

generation than the last. There 1s matter 1n this mysterious

image, and it adds to both the complexity and the power of

law as integrity.

Can that conception recognize a purer form of the law we

have? Here 1s an argument that it cannot. The actual, pres-

ent law, for Hercules, consists in the principles that provide

the best justification available for the doctrines and devices

of law as a whole. His god is the adjudicative principle of in-

tegrity, which commands him to see, so far as possible, the

law as a coherent and structured whole. There seems no

room 1n this picture for the idea of law made more coherent,

purer, than it actually 1s. If it 1s possible to make the system

more coherent, then this more coherent system is the actual,

present law, so once Hercules has worked out what the law

now is, there can be no purer law latent within it. Law as in-

tegrity (we might say) s the 1dea of law worked pure.

This 1s too crude: the sentimental distinction does have a

place within law as integrity. Our concept of law ties law to

the present justification of coercive force and so ties law to
