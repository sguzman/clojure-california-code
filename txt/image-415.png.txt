LAW BEYOND LAW

barristers from the general rules of negligence law is inde-

fensible, and he might know he has the technical power to

overrule the precedents protecting lawyers in that way. But

he might also believe it would be wrong suddenly to impose

liability on a particular barrister for acts in the past if no

court had previously signaled any change, because that bar-

rister would have been unlikely to insure himself against

such liability. Hercules would then perhaps consider chang-

ing the law prospectively only, in the way we 1magined a

pragmatist judge might in Chapter 5. But British practice is

largely innocent of that device, and he might settle for find-

ing some other way of warning barristers through his opin-

ion of changes to come.‚Äù Justice Hercules might think that

the best interpretation of the equal protection clause outlaws

distinctions between the rights of adults and those of chil-

dren that have never been questioned in the community,

and yet he might think i1t would be politically unfair, in the

sense distinguished in Chapter 3, for the law to impose that

view on a community whose family and social practices ac-

cepted such distinctions as proper and fundamental. I do not

mean that Hercules would always, in these sorts of cases, ac-

cept substantive inconsistency to keep faith with more proce-

dural principles, but only that the complex character of

adjudication makes it inevitable that he sometimes would.

The principle of local priority of interpretation we met in

Chapter 8 is another, more subtle kind of constraint that can

now be seen as functionally related to the institutional con-

straints just noticed. If a judge who accepts law as integrity

finds that two interpretations each fit the area of his immedi-

ate concern well enough to satisfy his interpretive con-

straints, he will expand the range of his study in a series of

concentric circles to include other areas of law and then de-

termine which of the two better fits the expanded range. But

he will normally respect the priority of the department of

law in which his immediate problem arises; he will severely

mark down some principle as an eligible interpretation of ac-

cident law if it uproots that department of law, even if it fits
