PREFACE

of references is entirely to their credit. I acknowledge the

generous support of the Filomen D’Agostino and Max E

Greenberg Research Fund of New York University School of

Law. I am grateful to David Erikson of Xyquest, Inc., who

volunteered to make special adaptations to that firm’s re-

markable word-processing program, XyWrite III, so that I

could use it for this book. Peg Anderson of Harvard Univer-

sity Press was exceptionally helpful and long-suffering in

tolerating changes beyond the last moment.

I owe more diffuse debts. My colleagues in the jurispru-

dential community of Great Britain, particularly John

Finnis, H. L. A. Hart, Neil MacCormick, Joseph Raz, and

William Twining, have been patient tutors to a dense pupil,

and my friends at New York University Law School, espe-

cially Lewis Kornhauser, William Nelson, David Richards,

and Laurence Sager, have been a steady source of imagina-

tive insight and advice. I am grateful, above all, to the pow-

erful critics I have been lucky enough to attract in the past;

this book might have been dedicated to them. Replying to

criticism has been, for me, the most productive of all work. I

hope I shall be lucky again.
