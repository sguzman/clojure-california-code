WHAT IS LAW?

structure of judicial instinct is different from other convic-

tions people have about government and justice.

[ have not yet offered reasons for my claim that the aca-

disagreement, which I shall soon supply. But if I am right,

we are in poor case. If laymen, teachers of jurisprudence,

working lawyers, and judges have no good answer to the

question how theoretical disagreement is possible and what

intelligent and constructive criticism of what our judges do.

No department of state 1s more important than our courts,

and none is so thoroughly misunderstood by the governed.

Most people have fairly clear opinions about how con-

about how most of these officials actually do behave. But

empty slogans, and I include the opinions of many working

lawyers and judges when they are writing or talking about

what they do. All this is a shame, and it is only part of the

damage. For we take an interest in law not only because we

use 1t for our own purposes, selfish or noble, but because law

Is our most structured and revealing social institution. If we

understand the nature of our legal argument better, we

know better what kind of people we are.

than arguments about law, and this book neglects much that

lecgal theory also studies. There is very little here about issues
