ment, given the various interpretive and political and moral

convictions he finds he has after the reflection I have tried to

provoke. If he leaves my argument early, at some crucial ab-

stract stage, then I have largely failed for him. If he leaves it

late, in some matter of relative detail, then I have largely

succeeded. I have failed entirely, however, if he never leaves

my argument at all.

What is law? Now I offer a different kind of answer. Law 1s

not exhausted by any catalogue of rules or principles, each

with 1its own dominion over some discrete theater of behav-

ior. Nor by any roster of officials and their powers each over

part of our lives. LLaw’s empire is defined by attitude, not ter-

ritory or power or process. We studied that attitude mainly

in appellate courts, where 1t 1s dressed for inspection, but it

must be pervasive in our ordinary lives 1f 1t is to serve us well

even in court. It is an interpretive, self-reflective attitude ad-

dressed to politics in the broadest sense. It 1s a protestant at-

titude that makes cach citizen responsible for imagining

what his society’s public commitments to principle are, and

what these commitments require in new circumstances. The

protestant character of law 1s confirmed, and the creative

role of private decisions acknowledged, by the backward-

looking, judgmental nature of judicial decisions, and also by

the regulative assumption that though judges must have the

last word, their word 1s not for that reason the best word.

Law’s attitude i1s constructive: it aims, In the interpretive

spirit, to lay principle over practice to show the best route to

a better future, keeping the right faith with the past. It 1s, fi-

nally, a fraternal attitude, an expression of how we are

united in community though divided in project, interest,

and conviction. That is, anyway, what law is for us: for the

pcople we want to be and the community we aim to have.
