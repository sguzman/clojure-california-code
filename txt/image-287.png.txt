INTEGRITY IN LAW

pretive claim 1s powerful and germane, however, only if it

begins where Hercules begins: it must claim to have looked

for a less skeptical interpretation and failed. Nothing is eas-

ler or more pointless than demonstrating that a flawed and

contradictory account fits as well as a smoother and more

attractive one. The internal skeptic must show that the

flawed and contradictory account is the only one available.

Liberalism and Contradiction

Is there a quick route to that ambitious negative claim? Crit-

ical legal studies purports to find one in what 1t takes to be

the philosophical faults of liberal political theory. This ar-

gument has two steps. It claims, first, that the constitutional

structure and main doctrinal lines of modern Western de-

mocracies can be justified only as an elaboration of a funda-

mentally liberal view of personality and community. It

insists that the distinction between adjudication and legisla-

tion, which is prominent in that structure, reflects a liberal

conception of freedom; it points to those features of the pri-

vate law of contract, tort, and property, for example, that

enforce liberal ideals of individual responsibility. It argues,

second, that liberalism, as a philosophical system combining

metaphysical and ethical ideas, 1s profoundly self-contradic-

tory and that the contradictions of liberalism therefore

ensure the chaos and contradiction of any available

interpretation of our law, the doom of Herculesâ€™ project.

This 1s an exciting argument, and anyone drawn to liber-

alism will find its first step compelling. Arguments for its sec-

ond step, however, about the incoherence of liberalism, have

so far been spectacular and even embarrassing failures. They

begin and end in a defective account of what liberalism is,

an account supported by no plausible reading of the philoso-

phers they count as liberals.

They seem wholly to ignore, moreover, the distinction we

have just found crucial to any internally skeptical argument,

the distinction between competition and contradiction in
