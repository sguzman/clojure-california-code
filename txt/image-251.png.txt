A Misleading Objection

A chain novelist, then, has many difficult decisions to make,

and different chain novelists can be expected to make these

differently. But his decisions do not include, nor are they

properly summarized as, the decision whether and how far

he should depart from the novel-in-progress he has been fur-

nished. For he has nothing he can depart from or cleave to

until he has constructed a novel-in-process from the text,

and the various decisions we have canvassed are all decisions

he must make just to do this. Suppose you have decided that

a soclorealist interpretation of the opening sections of A

Christmas Carol makes that text, on balance, the best novel-

so-far 1t can be, and so you continue the novel as an explora-

tion of the uniformly degrading master-servant relation

under capitalism rather than as a study of original sin. Now

suppose someone accuses you of rewriting the “real” novel to

produce a different one that you like better. If he means that

the “real” novel can be discovered in some way other than

by a process of interpretation of the sort you conducted, then

he has misunderstood not only the chain-novel enterprise

but the nature of literature and criticism. Of course, he may

mean only that he disagrees with the particular interpretive

and aesthetic convictions on which you relied. In that case

your disagreement is not that he thinks you should respect

the text, while you think you are free to i1gnore it. Your dis-

agreement 1s more interesting: you disagree about what re-

specting this text means.

LAW: THE QUESTION OF EMOTIONAL DAMAGES

Law as integrity asks a judge deciding a common-law case

like McLoughlin to think of himself as an author in the chain
