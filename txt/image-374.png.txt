THE CONSTITUTION

historicist, it follows that the equal protection clause does

not make segregation unconstitutional.

Historicism seems, at a first look, to be only a constitu-

tional form of the popular theory we studied in Chapter g:

the theory that statutes must be read in accordance with the

intentions of their authors. If we understand it as the crude,

speaker’s meaning version of that theory, it makes the men-

(al states of those who debated and enacted the Constitution

decisive over how its abstract language should be read. It

identifies, for each clause, a canonical moment of creation,

and 1nsists that what the framers thought then, no matter

how peculiar this might seem now, exhausts the Constitution

we have. In Chapter g we rejected the speaker’s meaning

version of the legislative intention theory, for reasons that

hold 1n the constitutional theater as well. We considered a

different and more attractive version: that statutes should be

read so as to conform to the convictions out of which their

authors voted. When Hermes explored that version he found

it necessary to identify and reconcile conflicts within each

legislator’s convictions, by interpreting the legislator’s record

as a whole, and then necessary to combine the restructured

convictions of different individual legislators into an overall

institutional scheme of conviction, using some appropriate

formula for that combination. He soon realized that he

would do better to interpret a statute directly, by asking

what set of convictions would provide the best justification

for it rather than the best interpretation of votes for it one by

one, because no formula for combining individual convic-

tions would be appropriate unless it yielded the same result

as a constructive interpretation of the statute 1tself.

A historicist who insists that constitutional interpretation

must match the intentions of the framers will meet the same

difhculties Hermes did, and if he is thoughtful he will end in

the same view. He will say, first; that the Fourteenth

Amendment must be read in whatever way best serves the

convictions of the congressmen and other legislators who
