THE COMMON LAW

they are when its abstract rights conflict. I will expand and

defend these claims in the remainder of this chapter, but we

should notice that the argument even thus far provides an-

other example of how law as integrity encourages a recipro-

cal interplay between law and morals in ordinary practical

life, even when no lawsuit is in prospect and each citizen is

judge for and of himself.

EQUALITY AND COMPARATIVE COST

The two compatible conceptions of equality I mentioned dif-

ity of resources, for example, requires compensating for

unequal inheritance of wealth and health and talent

through redistribution, but the libertarian conception rejects

redistribution as theft in principle. It would make some dif-

whose right is concrete and whose must yield. Since my main

purpose 1s to show the connection between a conception of

equality and accident law, I shall not argue but only assume

that equality of resources is superior to the libertarian con-

ception: it fits our legal and moral practices no worse and is

better in abstract moral theory.

Nor shall I try to improve on the crude statement of equal-

ity of resources I gave a moment ago; I rely on arguments

eisewhere to give it more shape and, I hope, appeal.'” We

need only the crude account to continue our construction of

the egalitarian justification of market-simulating judicial

decisions. I shall try to show that if someone does accept

equality of resources as furnishing a better overall inter-

conceptions of equality, then he should adopt a view of
