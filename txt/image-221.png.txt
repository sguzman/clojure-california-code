enough for these to be eligible as bare political communities.

We have noticed this already: we noticed that our most

widespread political convictions suppose the officials of these

communities to have special responsibilities within and to-

ward their distinct communities.”> We also have no diffi-

culty 1n describing the main obligations associated with

political communities. The central obligation is that of gen-

found so problematic. So our main interest lies in the four

conditions we identified. What form would these take in a

political community? What must politics be like for a bare

political society to become a true fraternal mode of associa-

tion?

Three Models of Communaty

We are able to imagine political society as associative only

because our ordinary political attitudes seem to satisfy the

first of our four conditions. We suppose that we have special

interests in and obligations toward other members of our

own nation. Americans address their political appeals, their

demands, visions, and 1deals, in the first instance to other

Americans; Britons to other Britons; and so forth. We treat

community as prior to justice and fairness in the sense that

questions of justice and fairness are regarded as questions of

what would be fair or just within a particular political

group. In that way we treat political communities as true as-

sociative communities. What further assumptions about the

obligations and responsibilities that flow from citizenship

could justify that attitude by satisfying its other conditions?

This is not a question of descriptive soctology, though that

discipline may have a part to play in answering 1it. We are

not concerned, that is, with the empirical question of which

attitudes or institutions or traditions are needed to create
