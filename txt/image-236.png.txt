INTEGRITY

R

programs that make sections and classes more equal in mate-

rial wealth as groups, and so forth. Decisions in pursuit of

these strategies, judged one by one, are matters of policy, not

principle; they must be tested by asking whether they ad-

vance the overall goal, not whether they give each citizen

what he i1s entitled to have as an individual. Subsidies to one

set of farmers may be justified on that test, even though sub-

sidies to a different set, as part of a different overall strategy,

would also have improved the general welfare, perhaps just

as much

Most working political theories also recognize, however

distinct individual rights as trumps over these decisions of

policy, rights that government s required to respect case by

case, decision by decision. These may be grand political

rights, like the right of each citizen to have his vote counted

as equal to any other citizen’s, or not to be denied freedom of

speech or conscience, even when violating these rights would

contribute to the general welfare. Or rights drawn more

directly from personal morality, like the right to be compen-

sated for 1injuries caused by another’s carelessness. Integrity

fixes its gaze on these matters of principle: government must

speak with one voice about what these rights are and so not

deny them to anyone at any time. Integrity’s effect on deci-

sions of policy is more diffuse. It requires, as I said, that gov-

ernment pursu€ some coherent Conceptlon ) s PN treatlng

people as equals means, but this 1s mainly a question of gen-

eral strategies and rough statistical tests. It does not other-

wise require narrow consistency within policies: it does not

requ1re that particular programs treat everyone the same

way

' Integrity’s concern with rights and principle does,

however, sometimes disqualify inconsistency of a certain

special kind. An American legislature could not decide that

no Catholic farmer should receive subsidies even if, incredi-

bly, there were sound reasons of policy for this discrimina-

tion

The distinction between policy and principle and the di-

rect connection between integrity and principle are impor-
