more reasonable to regard that kind of fit as one desideratum

that might be outweighed by others in deciding whether an

interpretation fits well enough. So we cannot reject the eco-

nomic interpretation on the sole ground that 1t would have

amazed the judges whose decisions it proposes to interpret.

THE QUESTION OF JUSTICE

Academic and Practical Theory

A successful interpretation must not only fit but also justify

the practice 1t interprets. The judicial decisions we have

been describing force some people to compensate others for

losses suffered because their otherwise lawful activities con-

flicted, and since these decisions are made after the event,

they are justified only if it 1s reasonable to suppose that peo-

ple held in damages should have acted in some other way or

should have accepted responsibility for the damage they

caused. So the decisions can be justified only by deploying

some general scheme of moral responsibility the members of

a community might properly be deemed to have, about

not injuring others or about taking financial responsibility

for their acts. Can we find a plausible scheme of responsibil-

ity, a plausible account of how people should behave, that

would suggest making liability turn on the market simula-

tion test?

We need yet another distinction: between what we might

call the academic and the practical elaboration of a moral

theory. People self-consciously settling on a scheme of per-

sonal responsibility for accidents, guided by an abstract

moral theory, would not try to define very concrete rules

capturing exactly what the abstract theory would require in

every 1imaginable circumstance if 1t were elaborated by an

academic moral philosopher able to take account of every

nuance of fact. If they did, they would produce too many

rules to understand and master. They would have two op-

tions which they could combine. They could settle on rules
