WHA'T IS LAW?

WHY IT MATTERS

[t matters how judges decide cases. It matters most to people

unlucky or litigious or wicked or saintly enough to find

themselves 1n court. Learned Hand, who was one of

Amcrica’s best and most famous judges, said he feared a

lawsult more than death or taxes. Criminal cases are the

most frightening of all, and they are also the most fascinat-

ing to the public. But civil suits, in which one person asks

compensation or protection from another for some past or

threatened harm, are sometimes more consequential than all

hut the most momentous criminal trials. The difference be-

tween dignity and ruin may turn on a single argument that

might not have struck another judge so forcefully, or even

the same judge on another day. People often stand to gain or

lose more by one judge’s nod than they could by any general

act of Congress or Parliament.

Lawsuits matter in another way that cannot be measured

in money or even liberty. There is inevitably a moral dimen-

sion to an action at law, and so a standing risk of a distinct

lorm of public injustice. A judge must decide not just who

shall have what, but who has behaved well, who has met the

responsibilities of citizenship, and who by design or greed or

insensitivity has ignored his own responsibilities to others or

cxaggerated theirs to him. If this judgment i1s unfair, then the

community has inflicted a moral injury on one of its mem-

hers because 1t has stamped him in some degree or dimen-

ston an outlaw. The injury 1s gravest when an innocent per-

son 1s convicted of a crime, but it is substantial enough
