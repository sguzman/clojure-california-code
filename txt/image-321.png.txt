THE COMMON LAW

1e1s!

comparative financial harm test would seem an unjust

method of adjudicating concrete rights; I cite them only to

show that the test would have to be qualified in a variety of

ways beyond those so far considered.

The Practical Elaboration

If we pursue these exceptions and qualifications, our theory

of personal responsibility will grow more complex. But

nothing we have discovered suggests that it would justify less

of the body of accident law our judges have developed than

the utilitarian argument would. Even 1f the academic elabo-

ration of equality of resources must be sensitive, as we saw,

to information touching the justice of the standing distribu-

tion of wealth between an actor and someone he knows his

activities will damage or put at risk, the practical elabora-

tion would be much less sensitive, case by case, to informa-

tion of that sort, and it would therefore be likely to include

the various doctrines about reasonableness, contributory

negligence, and the other baggage of the law of tort that we

met earlier. A legislator enforcing the resource equality

model of personal responsibility would have good reason, for

example, not to encourage people to speculate about

whether those they are likely to injure have more or less

wealth than equality of resources would justify. He would

think that justice overall would be better protected by leav-

ing redistribution to legislative schemes less capricious in

their impact. He would have other reasons for that conclu-

sion as well: 1t seems unjust that compensation to a victim

should depend on the relative wealth of the actor, if for no

other reason than the difthculty that would pose to someone

anxious to Insure against injury on sensible terms. So a legis-

lator would do better to allow people to base their decisions

about risk and liability on general information about the

tastes and preferences of ‘“average” people than to require

them to search for the special information that a full aca-

demic elaboration of resource equality would make perti-
