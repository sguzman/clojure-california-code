STATUTES

SRR

ol policy as well as of principle, and in some cases it might be

problematic which form of justification would be more ap-

propriate. (A law subsidizing contraception might be justi-

lird either out of respect for presumed rights that are

violated when contraceptives are unavailable, which is a

matter of principle, or out of concern that the population

not grow too rapidly, which is a matter of policy, or both.)

But the justification of policy we just imagined Hercules

viving, that the point of the statute is to protect rural

arcas from unsightly or disturbing development, does

not fit the text at all. For it is absurd to suggest that a

statesman anxious to secure that policy would choose

the fortuitous, even irrational, method of forbidding only

and all projects that jeopardized species, whether or not

they were otherwise disturbing or helpful to the rural en-

vironment.

Any competent justification of the Endangered Species

Act, then, must appeal to a policy of protecting endangered

species. No interpretation that disavowed that policy or

ranked 1t of little importance could even begin to justify the

provisions of the act, let alone its name.® Suppose Hercules

accepts this, and yet he thinks that no reasonable policy of

specles conservation would require halting an almost com-

pleted dam 1n this particular case. He will have no difhiculty

describing a competing policy that would justify that quali-

fication: the policy that public funds not be wasted. But the

(question remains whether he can attribute enough weight to

that competing policy, within the dimensions of the statute’s

text, to include that qualification in its overall justification;

that in turn will depend on how much weight he must assign

to the main policy of species preservation in order to justify

the remainder of the statute. (That interdependence of pol-

iy and weight explains much of the argument in the Su-

preme Court in the snail darter case.) If the text makes other

cxemptions or qualifications to the secretary’s power, even if

these have nothing to do with his power to halt projects
