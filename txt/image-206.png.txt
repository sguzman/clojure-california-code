INTEGRITY

N

argument requires, unless it 1s given more freely, and with

more genuine alternate choice, than just by declining to

build a life from nothing under a foreign flag. And even 1f

the consent were genuine, the argument would fail as an ar-

gument for legitimacy, because a person leaves one sovereign

only to join another; he has no choice to be free from sover-

eigns altogether.

The Duty to Be fust

Rawls argues that people in his original position would rec-

ognize a natural duty to support institutions that meet the

tests of abstract justice and that they would extend this duty

to the support of institutions not perfectly just, at least when

the sporadic injustice lay 1n decisions reached by fair, ma-

joritarian institutions.'’ Even those who reject Rawls’s gen-

eral method might accept the duty to support just or nearly

just institutions. That duty, however, does not provide a

good explanation of legitimacy, because 1t does not tie politi-

cal obligation sufficiently tightly to the particular commu-

nity to which those who have the obligation belong; it does

not show why Britons have any special duty to support the

institutions of Britain. We can construct a practical, contin-

gent argument for the special duty. Britons have more op-

portunity to aid British institutions than those of other

nations whose institutions they also think mainly just. But

this practical argument fails to capture the intimacy of the

special duty. It fails to show how legitimacy flows from and

defines citizenship. This objection points away from justice,

which 1s conceptually universalistic, and toward integrity,

which is already more personal 1n its different demands on

different communities, as the parent of legitimacy.
