INTEGRITY

reasons, both practical and expressive, a community might

have for accepting integrity as a political virtue. I empha-

sized one of these by constructing and contrasting three

models of community. I argued that a community of princi-

ple, which takes integrity to be central to politics, provides a

better defense of political legitimacy than the other models.

It assimilates political obligations to the general class of as-

sociative obligations and supports them in that way. This

defense 1s possible in such a community because a general

commitment to integrity expresses a concern by each for all

that is sufficiently special, personal, pervasive, and egalitar-

1an to ground communal obligations according to standards

for communal obligation we elsewhere accept.

Neither this argument nor the others we noticed more

briefly provides any conclusive argument for integrity on

first principles of political morality. I began by conceding

that integrity would have no distinct role to play in a com-

munity that was understood by all its members to be per-

fectly just and fair. I am defending an interpretation of our

own political culture, not an abstract and timeless political

morality; I claim only that the case for integrity i1s powerful

on the second, political dimension of interpretation, which

reinforces its strong claims on the first dimension of fit.

UNTIDY ENDNOTES

In the next several chapters we shall study a narrower and

more focused claim: that integrity is the key to the best con-

structive interpretation of our distinct legal practices and

particularly of the way our judges decide hard cases at law. I

shall argue that law as integrity provides a better interpreta-

tion of legal practice than the other two conceptions we have

considered. I must first add some further points to our gen-

eral account of integrity, however, points that could not

conveniently have been noticed in the main argument. I can
