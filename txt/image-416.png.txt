other departments well. The topology of departments is, as

we saw, part of his interpretive problem, and his judgments

about the boundaries of departments may be controversial

and will 1n any case change as law develops. But special

constraints apply to his judgments about boundaries: they

must in principle respect settled professional and public

opinions that divide law into substantial areas of public and

private conduct.

Integrity and Equality

We can capitalize on earlier discussions to show the cumula-

tive power of these various constraints, each of which ap-

peals to integrity of process to check substantive integrity.

In Chapter 8 Hercules decided that a large part of the law of

unintended injury in his jurisdiction can be seen as express-

ing the conception of equality he thinks best from the stand-

point of abstract justice, which is resource egalitarianism,

and he therefore adopted that conception in constructing his

interpretation of these parts of the law. In Chapter 10 he

quickly rejected the suggestion that this conception of equal-

ity (or any other) is made mandatory on states by the equal

protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He would

have to concede, moreover, that both state and nation fall

very far short of what equality of resources, in even its prac-

tical elaboration, would require by way of the distribution of

wealth, although some of the redistributive programs Con-

gress and many states have adopted are steps in that di-

rection. T'his concession does not threaten his view about the

best interpretation of unintended injury law, because no

other conception of equality fits that law nearly as well and

no other would provide any better fit with the tax and redis-

tributive programs that equality of resources fits only imper-

So he must settle for an account of equality and law that is
