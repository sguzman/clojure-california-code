STATUTES

KW,

specifically exempting the TVA project from the secretary’s

control. But it is extremely unlikely that any amendment

that specific would have been proposed. It i1s more likely that

an amendment would have exempted any project autho-

ments that, if adopted, might be thought to justify an ex-

ception for the TVA project. Smith would have voted for

some of these amendments had they been proposed and had

she been present to vote, and against others. Once again

Hermes would need to choose a particular form of amend-

ment as canonical in order to decide whether she would

have voted for or against the TVA if a suitable amend-

ment had been proposed; once again, any choice would be

arbitrary.

CONVICTIONS

A Fresh Start

Now return to the new i1dea Hermes was on the verge of

having before I made him think about counterfactual inten-

tions. He would not look to Smith’s hopes or expectations or

to what she would have done in circumstances that did not

arise but to the political convictions out of which she voted

for the act, or would have if she had been voting on princi-

ple. Smith, we may assume, had a variety of beliefs and atti-

tudes about justice and fairness and about which policies of

conservation would be most effective in making the commu-
