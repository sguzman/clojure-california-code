STATUTES

dam would disturb as they are. (Some of those who pressed

the secretary to declare the snail darter a threatened species

no doubt had that motive.) Would his method permit him to

say that, since the community would in fact be best served

by halting the dam, the act should be read as allowing the

secretary that power? Does that decision not make of the

act (at least in his opinion) the best piece of statesmanship it

can be?

It does not. For Hercules is not trying to reach what he

believes 1s the best substantive result, but to find the best

justification he can of a past legislative event. He tries to

show a piece of social history—the story of a democratically

elected legislature enacting a particular text in particular

circumstances—in the best light overall, and this means his

account must justify the story as a whole, not just its ending.

His interpretation must be sensitive, that is, not only to his

convictions about justice and wise conservation policy,

though these will play a part, but also to his convictions

about the ideals of political integrity and fairness and proce-

dural due process as these apply specifically to legislation in

a democracy.

Textual Integrity

Integrity and fairness will constrain justice and wisdom, for

Hercules, in a variety of ways. Integrity requires him to con-

struct, for each statute he 1s asked to enforce, some justifica-

tion that fits and flows through that statute and is, if

possible, consistent with other legislation in force.” This

means he must ask himself which combination of which

principles and policies, with which assignments of relative

importance when these compete, provides the best case for

what the plain words of the statute plainly require. Since

Hercules 1s now justifying a statute rather than a set of com-

mon-law precedents, the particular constraint we identified

in Chapter 7 no longer holds: he must consider justifications
