19. Mark Tushnet’s recent description of liberalism is represen-

tative of every account of that political theory I have seen in the

literature of critical legal studies. He admits that “any summary

description of the classical liberal view—the liberalism of Hobbes,

Locke, and Mill and that of Dworkin and Rawls—must be a cari-

cature.” But he then offers this description, which is more a forg-

ery. “Liberalism’s psychology posits a world of autonomous

individuals, each guided by his or her idiosyncratic values and

goals, none of which can be adjudged more or less legitimate than

those held by others. In such a world, people exist as isolated 1s-

lands of individuality who choose to enter into relations that can

committed.” (See Tushnet, “Following the Rules Laid Down: A

Critique of Interpretivism and Neutral Principles,” 96 Harvard

Law Review 781, 783 1., |1983].) There are several important muis-

takes here. First, most of T'ushnet’s iberals exphicitly recognize that

people are normally interested in one another’s fates. None of their

arguments depends on the preposterous assumption that people

cannot share values enough to sustain a common language and

other social institutions, and John Rawls, for example, has been

careful to deny that assumption. See his “Kantian Constructivism

in Moral Theory,” 77 Journal of Philosophy 515 (1980), and his

“Justice as Fairness: Political Not Metaphysical,” 14 Philosophy and

Public Affairs 223 (1985). (Some readers of Rawls’s A Theory of Justice

[Cambridge, Mass., 1977] make the mistake of thinking that the

mutually disinterested members of the “original position” he con-
