CONVENTIONALISM

ITS STRUCTURE

““The law is the law. It is not what the judges think it is, but

what it really 1s. Their job 1s to apply it, not to change it to

fit their own ethics or politics.” This is the view of most lay-

men and the anthem of the legal conservative. Read word by

word, it says almost nothing, certainly nothing controversial

for us. Everyone in our sample cases agreed that the law is

the law and must be enforced; they disagreed only about

what the law in fact was. But the slogan, however carelessly

drafted, means something more than banality; 1t stands for

an attitude that is important and open to challenge. It 1s

this: that collective force should be trained against individu-

als only when some past political decision has licensed this

explicitly in such a way that competent lawyers and judges

will all agree about what that decision was, no matter how

much they disagree about morality and politics.

The first of the three conceptions of law I introduced in

the last chapter, which I called conventionalism, shares the

general ambition of the popular slogan, though the inter-

pretation it builds 1s more subtle in two ways. First, conven-

tionalism explains how the content of past political decisions

can be made explicit and noncontestable. It makes law de-

pend on distinct social conventions it designates as legal

conventions; in particular on conventions about which insti-

complex political community, conventionalism insists, has

such conventions. In America it is settled by convention that

law is made by statutes enacted by Congress or the state leg-
