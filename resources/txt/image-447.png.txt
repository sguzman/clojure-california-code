3. I have discussed it at some length, trying to show its connec-

tions to the other virtues, in A Matter of Principle chap. 3.

4. I call this virtue “procedural” due process to distinguish 1t

from the different idea, which draws on justice as well, that is la-

tent 1in the “due process’” clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to

the United States Constitution, as this has been interpreted by the

Supreme Court in recent decades. See my “Reagan’s Justice,” New

York Review of Books, Nov. 8, 1984.

5. The contrast between fairness and justice is taken up again

in Chapter 6.

6. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962); Reynolds v. Sims, 377

U.S. 533 (1964); WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 377 U.S. 633 (1964);

Maryland Commuttee for Fair Representation v. Tawes, 377 U.S. 656

(1964); Davis v. Mann, 377 U.S. 678 (1964); Roman v. Sincock, 377

U.S. 695 (1964); Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly, 377 U.S.

713 (1964).

7. Compare Candler v. Crane, Christmas & Co., 1951, 1 All E.R.

426, particularly the dissenting opinion of Denning, L. J., with

Hedley Byrne & Co., Ltd. v. Heller & Partners, Ltd [1964] A.C. 465,

8. See A Matter of Principle, chap. 3.

9. See discussion in Chapter 6.

10. See, for useful distinctions within the general topic of group

or collective responsibility, Joel Feinberg, Doing and Deserving chap.

9 (Princeton, 1970).

11. In Chapter 6 I discuss fraternal obligations, those members

of a group have toward one another in virtue of common member-

ship, and I argue that under certain circumstances political com-

munities may be regarded as sponsoring fraternal obligations of

that sort. I should therefore make plain that I do not regard the

principles of collective responsibility we have been canvassing in

this discussion as aspects of fraternal obligation that hold only

when the conditions just mentioned are met. I leave open the

question of how far they hold, for example, in political commu-

nities that are insufficiently egalitarian to count as fraternal asso-

ciations of the kind discussed in Chapter 6.
