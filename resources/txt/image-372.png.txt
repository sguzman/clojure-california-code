tions are those liberals ordinarily have.

This new classificatory scheme is less rigid than the simple

distinction between judicial liberals and conservatives. Even

so, a particular justice might not fall easily into just two of

the four boxes it defines. He might combine conservative

positions about some aspects of fit with more relaxed opin-

camps. These labels are also highly misleading, however.

They suggest a distinction between judges who believe con-

should be based on extraconstitutional grounds.” This is an
