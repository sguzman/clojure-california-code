STATUTES

KL

the snail darter, however important Hercules believes this to

he, involve any question of principle, of rights particular citi-

+cns might be thought to have against others or the commu-

nity as a whole. It is a question of what state of affairs is best

lor everyone: Hercules believes that everyone’s life 1s dimin-

ished when a species becomes extinct, but he does not believe

that allowing a species to disappear unjustly favors some

pcople at the expense of others. So the conservation of

spectes 1s a paradigm of a kind of decision that should be

coverned by the will of the people, the kind of decision

that even legislators who accept the Burkean model of legis-

lative responsibility should not impose on their constituents

when the latter are united in the opposite opinion. If Her-

cules agrees, he will conclude that a legislative story that

supposes Congress to have indulged in unjustified paternal-

ism would be worse than a story in which 1t respected the

pcople’s choice, even though Hercules thinks this the wrong

eI les)

So in these circumstances Hercules’ convictions about

fairness place important obstacles between his own prefer-

cnces, even those that are consistent with the language of the

statute, and his judgment which interpretation is best, all

things considered. Since his judgment in this situation is

scensitive to general public opinion, it 1s also sensitive, for sev-

cral different reasons, to the expressed concrete convictions

of the various legislators who spoke 1n the debates, drafted

committee reports, and so forth. These statements are ordi-

narily good evidence of public opinion across the commu-

nity as a whole. Politicians are very often typical, at least in

their convictions, of the people who elect them; more to the

point, they are typically skillful at judging the convictions of

their constituents and choosing their public statements to

reflect these. If the debates over the Endangered Species Act

cxpressed some widespread and uncontradicted conviction

about the relative importance of the conservation of a minor

spectes, this would be strong evidence of a general public

sentiment 1n the same direction.
