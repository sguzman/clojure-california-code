cuting one person lies in policy—if the prosecution would be

too expensive, for example, or would for some reason not

contribute effectively to deterrence—integrity offers no rea-

reasons of policy are absent or reversed. But if the reasons

that argue against prosecution in one case are reasons of

principle—that the criminal statute did not give adequate

notice, for example—then integrity demands that these rea-

sons be respected for everyone else. Obviously integrity

would also condemn prosecutors’ decisions that discrimi-
