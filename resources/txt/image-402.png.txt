THE CONSTITUTION

longer.'Â® The plaintiff schoolchildren are being cheated of

what their Constitution, properly interpreted, defines as in-

dependent and equal standing in the republic; this is an in-

sult that must be recognized and removed. So if Plessy is

really precedent against integration, 1t must be overruled

now. Everything conspires toward the same decision. Ra-

cially segregated public schools do not treat black school-

children as equals under any competent interpretation of the

rights the Fourteenth Amendment deploys in the name of

racial equality, and official segregation is therefore unconsti-

tutional.

Rughts and Remedies

But now comes the question of remedy. Should Hercules

vote to outlaw segregated schools immediately, so that all

school districts now segregated must desegregate at once? Or

should he vote for some more gradual process of change, in

which case he will have to find some language to describe

how much delay will be permitted? Here are some argu-

ments for delay. A school system cannot reverse major insti-

tutional structures overnight. If schools segregated in June

try to reopen as integrated in September there will be chaos,

and the education of a cohort of students, both black and

white, will be damaged or destroyed. New catchment

boundaries must be drawn, and it may be difficult to respect

the tradition of neighborhood or even territorial education;

teachers as well as pupils must be reassigned, and the per-

sonal costs of these decisions will be diverse and difficult.

Problems of backlash will be even more urgent and threaten-

ing. Long-standing racial segregation is an important part of

the lives of those who wish to maintain 1t; their sense of self-

1dentity 1s challenged by any substantial weakening of segre-

gation, and these are seeds of violence as well as despair. The

problems could be ameliorated, if not entirely dissolved, by a

more stately and gradual process of change.
