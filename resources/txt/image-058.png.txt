INTERPRETIVE CONCEPTS

THE SEMANTIC STING

I shall call the argument I have just described, which has

caused such great mischief in legal philosophy, the semantic

sting. People are its prey who hold a certain picture of what

disagreement 1s like and when it i1s possible. They think we

can argue sensibly with one another if, but only if, we all ac-

cept and follow the same criteria for deciding when our

claims are sound, even if we cannot state exactly, as a philos-

opher might hope to do, what these criteria are. You and I

can sensibly discuss how many books I have on my shelf, for

example, only if we both agree, at least roughly, about what

a book is. We can disagree over borderline cases: I may call

something a slim book that you would call a pamphlet. But

we cannot disagree over what I called pivotal cases. If you do

not count my copy of Moby-Dick as a book because in your

view novels are not books, any disagreement is bound to be

senseless. If this simple picture of when genuine disagree-

ment is possible exhausts all possibilities, it must apply to

legal concepts, including the concept of law. Then the fol-

lowing dilemma takes hold. Either, in spite of first appear-

ances, lawyers actually all do accept roughly the same

criteria for deciding when a claim about the law is true or

there can be no genuine agreement or disagreement about

law at all, but only the idiocy of people thinking they dis-

agree because they attach different meanings to the same

sound. The second leg of this dilemma seems absurd. So

legal philosophers embrace the first and try to identify the

hidden ground rules that must be there, embedded, though
