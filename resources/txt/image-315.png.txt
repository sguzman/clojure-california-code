once anyone accepts the root idea of equality of resources he

will automatically and inevitably be driven to the conclu-

sions I report. I argue only that he will be required to make a

series of choices refining that conception for the cases we are

considering and that plausible choices would then direct

him to market simulation 1in most ordinary cases. My argu-

ment will not recommend the economic principle in all cases

in which partisans of the economic interpretation would

think it appropriate, however, because the egalitarian justi-

fication condemns rather than approves much of what they

The Main Line

Suppose you and I have roughly equal wealth, and neither is

handicapped or otherwise has special needs or requirements.

We discover that the activities we independently plan, each

in the enjoyment of general rights secured by property as-

signments, conflict. I want to learn some trumpet piece one

evening, and you want to work at algebra in the next apart-

ment. Or I want to drive my car very fast on a road you

would like to walk on in safety. Or I want my trains to run

next to a field on which you want to plant grain. My projects

intersect yours, and I have to decide, before I proceed, how

far I should adjust my plans to take account of your interests

and how far I should assume responsibility for any injury I

might cause you. It seems intuitively correct that this is at

least in part a matter of the relative costs to each of us of the

decisions I might make. If 1t would cost me only a little to

forgo my plans, but would cost you a great deal if I do not,

then this seems a good reason for my holding back or for

compensating you if I do go ahead.
