think 1t matters, usually decisively, whether these are accepted or

rejected. The classical theories try to explain this central and per-

vasive aspect of legal practice by describing the sense of proposi-

tions of law—what these mean to those who use them—and this

explanation takes the form either of definitions of “law” in the

older style or accounts of the “truth conditions” of propositions of

law—the circumstances in which lawyers accept or reject them—

in the more modern style.

uses to 1dentify the extension of law is itself likely to have a pen-

umbral area that can generate disputes in which “all that succeeds

INTERPRETIVE CONCEPTS

1. See my Taking Rights Seriously 101-5 (Cambridge, Mass. and

London, 1977), discussion of an unusual interpretive problem in a

chess tournament.

2. In what follows I assess this assumption, that creative inter-

pretation must be conversational interpretation, mainly by dis-

cussing an idea familiar to literary scholars: that interpreting a

work of literature means recapturing the intentions of its author.

But the assumption has a more general foundation in the philo-

sophical literature of interpretation. Wilhelm Dilthey, a German
