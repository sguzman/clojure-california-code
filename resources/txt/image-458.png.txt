choosing a negligence or a strict liability basis for hiability. Posner,

a Market Setting,” 70 American Economic Review: Papers and Proceed-

Journal of Legal Studies 1 (1980). See, more generally, “Symposium:

Efhiciency as a Legal Concern,” 8 Hofstra Law Review 485-770

about the economic interpretation, see A Matter of Principle chaps.

10. I mean that the argument now described is a form of utili-

tarian argument, not that any utilitarian argument must take this

form. Some philosophers who count themselves utilitarians insist

that the wellare or well-being they seek to maximize is very far

from being just a matter of happiness. But since it is very implau-

sible that a wealth-maximizing scheme of law would maximize

welfare on some conception more sensitive than happiness to other

components of human flourishing, I consider for the present argu-

ment only the historically more famihiar form of utilitarianism

that gives happiness a near exclusive role in fixing welfare.

Point (London, 1981).

Resources,” 10 Philosophy and Public Affairrs 283 (1981).

14. Robert Nozick saw that equality on some conceptions

would 1nevitably be corrupted by market transactions of almost

any sort—that 1s the force of his famous Wilt Chamberlin example

(sec his Anarchy, State, and Utopia 160-64 [New York, 1974]). He

had matcrial cquality in mind, however, and it would be wrong to

suppose, 1 argue in the text, that every conception of equality

other than the libertarian conception would have that conse-

quence.
