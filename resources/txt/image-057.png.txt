WHAT IS LAW?

grounds, not Earlâ€™s. So the two judges are not really dis-

agreeing about anything when one denies and the other

asserts this proposition. They are only talking past one

another. Their arguments are pointless in the most trivial

and irritating way, like an argument about banks when one

person has in mind savings banks and the other riverbanks.

Worse still, even when lawyers appear to agree about what

the law is, their agreement turns out to be fake as well, as if

the two people I just imagined thought they agreed that

there are many banks in North America.

These bizarre conclusions must be wrong. Law 1s a flour-

ishing practice, and though i1t may well be flawed, even fun-

damentally, it is not a grotesque joke. It means something to

say that judges should enforce rather than ignore the law,

that citizens should obey it except in rare cases, that officials

are bound by 1ts rule. It seems obtuse to deny all this just

because we sometimes disagree about what the law actually

1s. So our legal philosophers try to save what they can. They

grasp at straws: they say that judges in hard cases are only

pretending to disagree about what the law 1s, or that hard

cases are only borderline disputes at the margin of what is

clear and shared. They think they must otherwise settle into

some form of nihilism about law. The logic that wreaks this

havoc 1s the logic just described, the argument that unless

lawyers and judges share factual criteria about the grounds

of law there can be no significant thought or debate about

what the law 1s. We have no choice but to confront that ar-

gument. It is a philosophical argument, so the next stage of

our project must be philosophical as well.
