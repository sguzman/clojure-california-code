intervene in some way. But such cases are fairly rare; unilateralisim

would offer a decision 1n most hard cases.

g. Unilateralism would permit, however, a different kind of de-

cision: that Mr. O’Brian should win the present suit because there

1s no established rule to the contrary, but that the judge should

declare a new rule for the future so that people in Mrs. McLough-

lin’s position can recover 1n later cases, since they can then appeal

to that new rule as having become part of the explicit extension

through his decision. Judges do occasionally decide in this way

when they are not simply making a new rule when none existed

but overruling a past rule on which the winning party might have

relied. This practice, called “prospective” overruling, is discussed

further in Chapter g

10. Sce the discussion of the asymmetry of civil and criminal

law 1n Taking Rights Serously 100.

1. See, e.g., Bowie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347 (1964) . Brit-

ish courts have been far less solicitous. See Shaw v. Director of Public

Prosecutions [1962] A.C. 220.

12. Unilateralism would be even more effective in protecting

people against unanticipated state intervention if it always as-

signed the plaintiff the burden of proof on factual issues.

13. Compare G. Postema, “Coordination and Convention at

the Foundations of Law,” 11 Journal of Legal Studies 165 (1982).

Compare F. Hayek, Law, Legislation and Liberty (2 vols., Chicago,

1973, 1976).

5. PRAGMATISM AND PERSONIFICATION

1. See Guido Calabresi, A Common Law for the Age of Statutes

(Cambridge, Mass., 1982).

2. This case for pragmatism appealed to Jonathan Swift. Gul-

liver reported, “It is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever

hath been done before may legally be done again: and therefore

they take special care to record all the decisions formerly made

against common justice and the general reason of mankind. These,

under the name of precedents, they produce as authorities to justify

the most niquitous opinions.” Gullwer’s Travels bk. 4, chap. g5

(1726). 1 owe this reference to William Ewald.
