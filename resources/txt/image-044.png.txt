WHAT IS LAW?

SEMANTIC THEORIES OF LAW

Propositions and Grounds of Law

Earlier in this chapter I described what I called the plain-

fact view of law. This holds that law depends only on mat-

ters of plain historical fact, that the only sensible disagree-

ment about law is empirical disagreement about what legal

institutions have actually decided in the past, that what I

called theoretical disagreement is i1llusory and better under-

stood as argument not about what law 1s but about what it

should be. The sample cases seem counterexamples to the

plain-fact view: the arguments in these cases seem to be

about law, not morality or fidelity or repair. We must there-

fore put this challenge to the plain-fact view: why does it

insist that appearance is here an illusion? Some legal phi-

losophers offer a surprising answer. They say that theoretical

disagreement about the grounds of law must be a pretense

because the very meaning of the word *“law” makes law de-

pend on certain specific criteria, and that any lawyer who

rejected or challenged those criteria would be speaking self-

contradictory nonsense.

We follow shared rules, they say, in using any word: these

rules set out criteria that supply the word’s meaning. Our

rules for using “law” tie law to plain historical fact. It does

not follow that all lawyers are aware of these rules in the

sense of being able to state them in some crisp and compre-

hensive form. For we all follow rules given by our common

language of which we are not fully aware. We all use the

word “‘cause,” for example, in what seems to be roughly the

same way—we agree about which physical events have

caused others once we all know the pertinent facts—yet most

of us have no idea of the criteria we use In making these

judgments, or even of the sense in which we are using criteria

at all. It falls to philosophy to explicate these for us. This

may be a matter of some difhiculty, and philosophers may
