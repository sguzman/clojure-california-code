THE COMMON LAW

3

—_—

Once the legislature has made its choice, however, then 1n-

dividuals do have legal rights to what they have been as-

signed, and under law as integrity these rights extend not

only to the explicit assignments but to the principled exten-

sion of these into cases not expressly decided. In this chapter

we have been studying the proper ground of that principled

extension in certain cases. I can now restate my thesis in the

following way. When private citizens encounter conflicts be-

tween their general abstract common-law rights in property

(as distinct from their rights under particular regulative stat-

utes embodying discrete policies like those I just imagined)

they must adjudicate these conflicts by repairing to the basic

principle the overall scheme is meant to respect, which 1s the

principle that it must treat them as equals. They must ask

which conception of equal concern the scheme as a whole is

best interpreted as expressing, and assume the extension of

concrete rights that, of the choices available to them in the

circumstances, best serves that conception. I have been sup-

posing, in order to illustrate the character and complexity of

that interpretive problem, that resource equality provides

the right conception for that purpose, and I claim that the

main lines of American and British nuisance and negligence

law match a plausible solution of the interpretive problem

on that assumption. That process i1s not appropriate, how-

ever, when conflicts arise under particular regulative statutes

with distinct policies, because the rights people have under

such a statute depend too much on those special policies to

authorize any direct repair to a conception of equality. Citi-

zens’ responsibilities then depend on a different set of issues,

and these form our next topic.
