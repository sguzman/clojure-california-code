CONVENTIONALISM

150

tionalist strategy would have been more suitable, then prag-

matism will already have brought the reigning pattern of

adjudication very close to conventionalism. For both judges

and ordinary people will have come to see that the area that

should be dominated by predictability is very large, and citi-

zens will make their plans assuming that judges take that

view and so will not often reverse settled legal practice. But

the reverse is not true. The conventionalist system lacks the

capacity to reach anything like the flexibility of pragmatism,

because any relaxation would inevitably involve the defeat

of publicly encouraged expectation.

I do not mean to endorse pragmatism. Its merits and

faults are the subject of the next chapter. I mean only to

provide the following answer to the argument from coordi-

nation as an argument for conventionalism. If we are

tempted to choose conventionalism on the ground that it

provides an acceptable strategy for reaching the most efh-

cient balance between certainty and flexibility, then we

should choose pragmatism, which seems a far better strat-

egy, instead. We can summarize. In the earlier part of this

chapter I argued that conventionalism fits our legal practices

badly. I asked whether that conception would justify these

practices, by providing an attractive picture of lawâ€™s point, if

it fit well. We have now seen that it would not, that we have

no reason to strain to make i1t fit. The failure of convention-

alism as an interpretation of our law is complete: it fails on

both dimensions of interpretation.
