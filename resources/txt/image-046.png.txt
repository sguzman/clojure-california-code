WHAT IS LAW?

tic theories of law, as well as the earlier theories that were

more candidly definitional.”

Legal Positivism

Semantic theories suppose that lawyers and judges use

mainly the same criteria (though these are hidden and un-

recognized) in deciding when propositions of law are true

or false; they suppose that lawyers actually agree about the

grounds of law. These theories disagree about which criteria

lawyers do share and which grounds these criteria do stipu-

late. Law students are taught to classify semantic theories

according to the following rough scheme. The semantic

theories that have been most influential hold that the shared

criteria make the truth of propositions of law turn on certain

specified historical events. These positivist theories, as they

are called, support the plain-fact view of law, that genuine

disagreement about what the law 1s must be empirical dis-

agreement about the history of legal institutions. Positivist

theories differ from one another about which historical facts

are crucial, however, and two versions have been particu-

larly important in British jurisprudence.

John Austin, a nineteenth-century English lawyer and lec-

turer, said that a proposition of law is true within a particu-

lar political society if it correctly reports the past command

of some person or group occupying the position of sovereign

in that society. He defined a sovereign as some person or

group whose commands are habitually obeyed and who is

not in the habit of obeying anyone else.” This theory be-

came the object of intense, and often scholastic, debate.

Legal philosophers argued about whether certain obviously

true propositions of law—propositions about the number of

signatures necessary to make a will legally valid, for exam-

ple—could really be said to be true in virtue of anyone’s

command. (After all, no one has commanded you or me to

make any will at all, let alone to make a valid will.) They
