INTERPRETIVE CONCEPTS

o3

author’s place shifts as tradition builds, argue for a retro-

spective Interpretation that makes the best reading of his

work depend on what was written a century later.'' Still

more radical challenges, which insist on the relevance of the

social and political consequences of art or of structuralist or

deconstructionist semantics, or 1insist on narrative con-

structed between author and reader, or seem to reject the

enterprise of interpretation altogether, deploy very different

conceptions of where the conceptually presupposed value of

art really lies.

This 1s a frighteningly simplistic account of the complex

interaction between interpretation and other aspects of cul-

ture; I mean only to suggest how the argument over inten-

tion 1n Interpretation, located within the larger social

practice of contesting the mode of art’s value, 1tself assumes

the more abstract goal of constructive interpretation, aiming

to make the best of what 1s interpreted. I must be careful not

to be misunderstood. I am not arguing that the author’s in-

tention theory of artistic interpretation is wrong (or right),

but that whether it i1s wrong or right and what it means (so

far as we can think about these issues at all within our own

tradition of criticism) must turn on the plausibility of some

more fundamental assumption about why works of art have

the value their presentation presupposes. Nor do I mean that

a critic who 1s concerned to reconstruct Fellini’s intentions 1n

making La Strada must have in mind as he works some theory

that connects intention to aesthetic value: critical intention

1s no more a mental state than artistic intention. Nor do [

mean that if he reports that intention as including a re-

working of Philomel, though this was never recognized by

Fellini, he must be conscious of having the thought that the

film is a better film read that way. I mean only that in the

usual critical circumstances we must be able to attribute

some such view to him, in the way we normally attribute

convictions to people, if we are to understand his claims as

interpretive rather than, for example, mocking or deceitful.'?

I do not deny what is obvious, that interpreters think within
