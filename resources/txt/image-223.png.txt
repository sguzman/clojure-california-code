INTEGRITY

model. It supposes that members of a political community

accept a general commitment to obey rules established in a

certain way that is special to that community. Imagine self-

interested but wholly honest people who are competitors in a

game with fixed rules or who are parties to a limited and

transient commercial arrangement. They obey the rules they

have accepted or negotiated as a matter of obligation and

not merely strategy, but they assume that the content of

these rules exhausts their obligation. They have no sense

that the rules were negotiated out of common commitment

to underlying principles that are themselves a source of fur-

ther obligation; on the contrary, they take these rules to rep-

resent a compromise between antagonistic interests or points

of view. If the rules are the product of special negotiation, as

in the contract case, each side has tried to give up as little in

return for as much as possible, and it would therefore be un-

fair and not merely mistaken for either to claim that their

agreement embraces anything not explicitly agreed.

The conventionalist’s conception of law we considered in

Chapter 4 1s a natural mate to this rulebook model of com-

munity. Conventionalism suits people each trying to ad-

vance his or her own conception of justice and fairness in the

right relation through negotiation and compromise, subject

only to the single overriding stipulation that once a compro-

mise has been reached in the appropriate way, the rules that

form its content will be respected until they are changed by

a fresh compromise. A conventionalist philosophy coupled

to a rulebook model of community would accept the internal

compromises of our checkerboard statutes, as compromises

reached through negotiation that ought to be respected as

much as any other bargain. The first two models of commu-

nity—community as a matter of circumstance and as a mat-

ter of rules—agree in rejecting the only basis we might have

for opposing checkerboard compromises, which 1s the idea

of integrity, that the community must respect principles

necessary to justify one part of the law in other parts as
