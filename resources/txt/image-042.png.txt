WHAT IS LAW?

S

lordships revealed an important difference of opinion about

the proper role of considerations of policy in deciding what

result parties to a lawsuit are entitled to have.

After the American Civil War the victorious North amended

the Constitution to end slavery and many of its incidents

and consequences. One of these amendments, the Four-

teenth, declared that no state might deny any person the

“equal protection of the laws.” After Reconstruction the

southern states, once more in control of their own politics,

segregated many public facilities by race. Blacks had to ride

in the back of the bus and were allowed to attend only segre-

gated schools with other blacks. In the famous case of Plessy

v. Ferguson™ the defendant argued, ultimately before the

Supreme Court, that these practices of segregation automat-

ically violated the equal protection clause. The Court re-

jected their claim; it said that the demands of that clause

were satisfied if the states provided separate but equal facili-

ties and that the fact of segregation alone did not make facil-

ities automatically unequal.

In 1954 a group of black schoolchildren in Topeka, Kan-

sas, raised the question again.”® A great deal had happened

to the United States in the meantime—a great many blacks

had died for that country in a recent war, for example—and

segregation seemed more deeply wrong to more people than

it had when Plessy was decided. Nevertheless, the states that

practiced segregation resisted integration fiercely, particu-

larly in the schools. Their lawyers argued that since Plessy

was a decision by the Supreme Court, that precedent had to

be respected. This time the Court decided for the black

plaintiffs. Its decision was unexpectedly unanimous, though

the unanimity was purchased by an opinion, written by

Chief Justice Earl Warren, that was in many ways a com-

promise. He did not reject the “separate but equal” formula
