THE COMMON LAW

overall pattern of economic activity—trains slowing or crops

not being planted—that the various train companies and

farmers would arrange through contract if transaction costs

were zero. But he should also take into account the likely

transaction costs to facilitate bargains in those discrete and

special situations where the economic facts are contrary to

his overall prediction.” If he thinks, for example, that it

would be cheaper for the train company to initiate and con-

duct negotiation when the facts fall out as in Case 2 than for

the farmer to do this when they fall out as in Case 1, then

this argues for imposing liability generally on train com-

panies rather than letting the loss fall on farmers. In this way

a lawmaker maximizes community wealth by trying to

gauge what actual negotiation would have produced if it

were possible.

COMPLEXITIES

The Reasonable Man

A lawmaker need not always choose between flat general

rules of that character. A more sophisticated economic anal-

ysis might show that some more complex rule, more sensitive

to the balance of economic facts in particular cases, would

produce more wealth for the community. Suppose that if the

Vulcan Express runs at its highest possible speed over its par-

ticular route it will destroy $1,100 in crops planted near its

tracks; 1f it runs at the lower speed necessary to avoid all

sparks, the train company will lose $1,000. But if it runs at

the intermediate speed of (say) 70 miles an hour, the train

company will lose $500 in income, and the fewer sparks will

destroy only $400 in grain. Community wealth is greater in

this case than in either of the former cases, and so a legislator

would do better, by the wealth test, to choose a rule making

that train liable for that damage only if it exceeds 70 miles

an hour. But there might be a still better speed for him to

choose. And even if he had all the facts necessary to choose
