INTEGRITY

obligations of friendship in the normal case only when some

situation requires them to honor these obligations, or when

they have grown weary of or embarrassed by the friendship,

and then it 1s too late to reject them without betrayal. Other

forms of association that carry special responsibilities—of ac-

ademic colleagueship, for example—are even less a matter of

free choice: someone can become my colleague even though I

voted against his appointment. And the obligations some

members of a family owe to others, which many people

count among the strongest fraternal obligations of all, are

matters of the least choice.

We must therefore account for associative obligations, if

we accept these at all, in the different way I suggested a mo-

ment ago in describing how most people think of them. We

have a duty to honor our responsibilities under social prac-

tices that define groups and attach special responsibilities to

membership, but this natural duty holds only when certain

other conditions are met or sustained. Reciprocity is promi-

nent among these other conditions. I have special responsi-

bilities to my brother in virtue of our brotherhood, but these

are sensitive to the degree to which he accepts such responsi-

bilities toward me; my responsibilities to those who claim

that we are friends or lovers or neighbors or colleagues or

countrymen are equally contingent on reciprocity. But we

must be careful here: if associative concepts are interpre-

tive—if it can be an open question among friends what

friendship requires—then the reciprocity we demand can-

not be a matter of each doing for the other what the latter

thinks friendship concretely requires. Then friendship would

be possible only between people who shared a detailed

conception of friendship and would become automati-

cally more contractual and deliberative than 1t is, more

a matter of people checking in advance to see whether

their conceptions matched well enough to allow them to be

The reciprocity we require for associative obligations must

be more abstract, more a question of accepting a kind of re-
