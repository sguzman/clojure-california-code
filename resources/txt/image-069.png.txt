INTERPRETIVE CONCEPTS

of “consciousness’ by bringing Shakespeare’s intentions for-

ward into a very different culture located at the end of a very

different history.® If he is successful in this, his reading of

Shylock will probably be very different from Shakespeare’s

concrete vision of that character. It may in some respects be

contrary, replacing contempt or irony with sympathy, for

example, or it may change emphasis, perhaps seeing Shy-

lock’s relation to Jessica as much more important than

Shakespeare, as director, would have seen it.” Artistic inten-

tion, that is, 1s complex and structured: different aspects or

levels of intention may conflict in the following way. Fidelity

to Shakespeare’s more discrete and concrete opinions about

Shylock, ignoring the effect his vision of that character

would have on contemporary audiences, might be treachery

to his more abstract artistic purpose.® And “applying” that

abstract purpose to our situation is very far from a neutral,

historical exercise in reconstructing a past mental state. It in-

evitably engages the interpreter’s own artistic opinions in

just the way the constructive account of creative interpreta-

tion suggests, because 1t seeks to find the best means to

express, given the text in hand, large artistic ambitions that

Shakespeare never stated or perhaps even consciously de-

fined but that are produced for us by our asking how the

play he wrote would have been most i1lluminating or power-

ful to his age.

Stanley Cavell adds further complexity by showing how

even the concrete, detailed intentions of an artist can be

problematic.” He notices that a character in Fellini’s film La

Strada can be seen as a reference to the Philomel legend, and

he asks what we need to know about Fellini in order to say

that the reference was intentional (or, what is different, not

unintentional). He imagines a conversation with Fellini 1n

which the filmmaker says that although he has never heard

of the story before, it captures the feeling he had about his

character while filming, that is, that he now accepts 1t as part

of the film he made. Cavell says that he is inclined in these

circumstances to treat the reference as intended. Cavell’s
