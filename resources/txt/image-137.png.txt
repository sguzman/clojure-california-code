CONVENTIONALISM

thinks the implicit extension includes one or the other of

these latter propositions, but they disagree which, because

they disagree which solution best interprets the abstract

goal-—on which they agree—of equality of opportunity in

court.

TWO KINDS OF CONVENTIONALISM

Now we can distinguish what might seem to be two forms or

versions of conventionalism. The first, which we might call

“strict”’ conventionalism, restricts the law of a community to

the explicit extention of its legal conventions like legislation

<

and precedent. The second, call 1t

soft” conventionalism,

insists that the law of a community includes everything

within the implicit extension of these conventions. (A group

of judges who were all soft conventionalists would disagree

about the exact content of the law because they would dis-

agree about the content of this implicit extention.) It makes

a great difference which of these two forms of conventiona-

lism we are to consider. Strict conventionalism would be a

very restrictive conception of law for us because the explicit

extensions of our putative conventions of legislation and

precedent contain very little that has much practical impor-

tance 1n actual litigation. If we tried to describe a theory of

legislation sufficiently uncontroversial to command close to

universal assent among our lawyers and judges, we would

be limited to something like this: if the words of a statute

admit of only one meaning, no matter in what context they

are uttered, and if we have no reason to doubt that this

1s the meaning understood by all the legislators who voted

for or against the statute or abstained, and the statute

so understood achieves no results not intended by all those

who voted for it and would be so understood by all the

members of the public to whom it is addressed, and could

not be thought by any sensible person to violate any of the

substantive or procedural constraints of the Constitution,
