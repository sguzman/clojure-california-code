WHAT IS LAW?

1. Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 486 (1954).

2. Priestley v. Fowler |1837] 3 M. & W. 1.

3. Sce the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948, 35 Hals-

bury’s Statutes of FEngland 548 (3rd ed.).

4. Attorney-General v. Jonathan Cape Ltd. [1975] 3 All E. R. 484.

5. So do law school examiners marking examination papers.

Some people are made uncomfortable using “true” and ‘““false” in

this way, but they are happy to say that propositions of law can be

6. 1 have in mind the legal “‘realists” discussed later in this

Chapter 7 (see, generally, 38 Stanford Law Review 1-674 [1984],

symposium on critical legal scholarship).

7. See, e.g., Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process

especially at 165-80 (New Haven, 1921).

8. These possibilities are discussed in Chapters g and 10.

9. Oliver Wendell Holmes, “The Path of the Law,” 10 Harvard

Law Review (1897).

10. Riggs v. Palmer, 115 N.Y. 506, 22 N.E. 188 (1889).

11. Id. at 18qg.

12. There are serious enough problems in this intermediate

principle, and we shall consider some of these in Chapter g.

13. Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978). John

Oakley pointed out the value of this case as a leading example.

14. The Endangered Species Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. g3-205,
