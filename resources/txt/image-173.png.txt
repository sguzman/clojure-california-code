PRAGMATISM AND PERSONIFICATION

what is best for society as a whole, freed from any supposed

rights flowing from consistency, but presenting these for un-

known reasons in the false uniform of rules dug out of the

past. Pragmatism requires epicycles to survive as an eligible

interpretation of our own practice, and these epicycles can

be tolerated only if pragmatism is so powerful along the sec-

others would choose a community with fewer incidents of

injustice, with a better cultural tradition and what is called a

higher quality of life. Pragmatism does not rule out any the-

ory about what makes a community better. But it does not

take legal rights seriously. It rejects what other conceptions

of law accept: that people can have distinctly legal rights as

trumps over what would otherwise be the best future prop-

erly understood. According to pragmatism what we call

legal rights are only the servants of the best future: they are

instruments we construct for that purpose and have no inde-

pendent force or ground.

It 1s possible to miss this important point about pragma-

tism, however, and we should be careful not to fall into the

trap. Lawyers who think that judges should take a prag-

matic attitude toward legal rights sometimes say the com-

munity has actually decided that they should, at least

tacitly. The community has decided, that is, to delegate to
