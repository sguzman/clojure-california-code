THE CONSTITUTION

IR

Constitution gives him, and this means a theory that does

not contradict through procedure what the document de-

mands in substance. He might arrive at the following theory

or something close to it: the Court’s strategies of decree must

search out the most effective and immediate enforcement of

substantive constitutional rights consistent with the interests

of those who claim them but must not otherwise defer to or

try to accommodate the interests of people who want to sub-

vert those rights.

The Supreme Court 1n Brown settled on a formula of en-

forcement that, in retrospect at least, did not meet that stan-

dard.”’ It said that desegregation must proceed “with all

deliberate speed,” and this language proved to be a charter

for obstruction and delay. It would have been better if the

Court had attempted to provide a more precise schedule,

even though that strategy might have jeopardized the una-

nimity of its decision. Much of the litigation that tollowed

Brown would have been inevitable anyway, however, because

the social revolution that case announced was both national

and foundational and required dozens of further decisions in

circumstances and on terrain very different from those of

Brown. The most difhicult problems of law appeared, in fact,

not in southern states with a long history of segregation by

law but in northern states, where school segregation had

been achieved not by explicit racial separation but by more

subtle decisions drawing school district boundaries, for ex-

ample. The federal courts had to decide under which cir-

cumstances a state’s failure to reverse this more subtle

history of segregation was a violation of the principles an-

nounced 1n Brown, and, when 1t was, what orders the courts

should and could make by way of remedy.

The courts developed a distinct jurisprudence of racial in-

tegration, neither entirely successful nor entirely coherent,

but nevertheless largely a credit to law.”' For a time federal

judges 1ssued and supervised decrees that brought them deep

into the normal jurisdiction of school superintendents and
