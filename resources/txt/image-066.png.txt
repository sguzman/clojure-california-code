INTERPRETIVE CONCEPTS

I offer this constructive account as an analysis of creative

interpretation only. But we should notice in passing how the

constructive account might be elaborated to fit the other two

contexts of interpretation I mentioned, and thus show a deep

connection among all forms of interpretation. Understand-

ing another person’s conversation requires using devices and

presumptions, like the so-called principle of charity, that

have the effect in normal circumstances of making of what

And the interpretation of data in science makes heavy use of

standards of theory construction like simplicity and elegance

and verifiability that reflect contestable and changing as-

sumptions about paradigms of explanation, that is, about

what features make one form of explanation superior to an-

other.* The constructive account of creative interpretation,

therefore, could perhaps provide a more general account of

interpretation in all its forms. We would then say that all in-

terpretation strives to make an object the best it can be, as an

instance of some assumed enterprise, and that interpretation

takes different forms in different contexts only because dif-

ferent enterprises engage different standards of value or

success. Artistic interpretation differs from scientific inter-

pretation, we would say, only because we judge success in

works of art by standards different from those we use to

judge explanations of physical phenomena.

INTERPRETATION AND AUTHOR’S INTENTION

The constructive account of interpretation will strike many

readers as bizarre, however, even when it is limited to crea-

tive interpretation or, more narrowly still, to the interpreta-

tion of social practices like courtesy. They will object because

they prefer the popular account of creative interpretation I

mentioned: that creative interpretation i1s only conversa-
