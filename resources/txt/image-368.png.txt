THE CONSTITUTION

IS CONSTITUTIONAL LAW BUILT ON A MISTAKE?

We began with a depressing report of the state of the popu-

lar argument about how judges should decide cases. In the

United States the argument is most heated and most con-

fused when the judges in question belong to the Supreme

Court and the cases in point are constitutional events testing

whether Congress or some state or the president has the legal

power to do something 1t or he has tried to do. The Consti-

tution creates only limited powers 1n these institutions and

declares important disabilities in each. It denies the Senate

power to originate a money bill; and it denies the com-

mander in chief power to quarter soldiers in private houses

in peacetime. Other constraints are notoriously abstract.

The Fifth Amendment insists that Congress not take “life,

b

liberty or property” without ‘“‘due process of law,

1405

Eighth outlaws ‘“‘cruel and unusual” punishments, and the

Fourteenth, which dominated our sample case Brown, re-

quires that no state deny any person “the equal protection of

the law.”

It does not follow as a matter of iron logic that the Su-

preme Court should have the power to decide when these

limits have been transgressed. For the Constitution might

have been interpreted as laying down directions to Congress,

the president, and state officials that these officers had a

legal as well as a moral duty to follow, but making them

their own judges. The Constitution would then have played

a very different and much weaker role in American politics:

it would have served as a background for political arguments
