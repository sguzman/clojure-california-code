55 miles an hour and that people in Britain have a legal duty

to pay for food they order in a restaurant. At least this goes

without saying except 1n very unusual circumstances. A

critic might therefore be tempted to say that the complex

account we have developed of judicial reasoning under law

as integrity is a method for hard cases only. He might add

that 1t would be absurd to apply the method to easy cases—

no judge needs to consider questions of fit and political mo-

rality to decide whether someone must pay his telephone

bill—and then declare that in addition to his theory of hard

cases, Hercules needs a theory about when cases are hard, so

he can know when his complex method for hard cases is ap-

propriate and when not. The critic will then announce a seri-

ous problem: it can be a hard question whether the case at

hand is a hard case or an easy case, and Hercules cannot de-

cide by using his technique for hard cases without begging

This 1s a pseudoproblem. Hercules does not need one

method for hard cases and another for easy ones. His method

1s equally at work 1n easy cases, but since the answers to the

questions 1t puts are then obvious, or at least seem to be so

we are not aware that any theory is at work at all.'* We think

the question whether someone may legally drive faster than

the stipulated speed limit 1s an easy one because we assume

at once that no account of the legal record that denied that

paradigm would be competent. But someone whose convic-

tions about justice and fairness were very different from ours

might not find that question so easy; even if he ended by

agreeing with our answer, he would insist that we were

wrong to be so confident. This explains why questions con-

sidered easy during one period become hard before they

again become easy questions—with the opposite answers
