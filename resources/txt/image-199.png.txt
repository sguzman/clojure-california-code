INTEGRITY

these communities. The American Constitution provides a

federal system: 1t recognizes states as distinct political com-

munities and assigns them sovereignty over many issues of

principle. So there is no violation of political integrity in the

fact that the tort laws of some states differ from those of

others even over matters of principle. Each sovereign speaks

with a single voice, though not in harmony with other sover-

the higher-order decisions, taken at the constitutional level,

about the division of power between the national and the

more local levels. Some scholars and politicians opposed to

the Constitution should be understood to leave decisions

about abortion to the various states, so that some could per-

leaving the abortion issue to individual states to decide dif-

the American constitutional scheme, which makes other 1m-

IS INTEGRITY ATTRACTIVE?

I shall offer no further argument for my claim that our polit-

ical life recognizes integrity as a political virtue. The case is

now strong enough for the weight of interest to shift to the

other dimension of interpretation. Do we do well to interpret

our politics that way? Is our political culture more attractive

if seen as accepting that virtue? I have already described, in

Chapter 5, an obvious challenge to integrity. A pragmatist

anxlous to reject integrity would attack the deep, working
